id="simple-table-of-contents-1">Introduction</h2> <div> <div> <div>Compared with some parts of the world East Africa is fortunate in the relatively small losses of stock which occur from poisonous plants. Although there are a great number of plants which have been shown to be toxic by drenching experiments only a few are known to have been responsible for actual deaths under natural conditions. Many illnesses which at one time were attributed to plant poisoning are now recognised as being due to infectious diseases and not to poisoning at all.</div> <div> </div> <div>Except in the case of individual, newly introduced animals, isolated cases of plant poisoning are rare. Plant poisoning usually occurs as an outbreak and as a result when it does occur, losses may be heavy.</div> <div> </div> <div>Animals which have been bred in a particular district usually know which plants are edible and which are not. Poisoning in such animals may, however, occur when grazing is scarce, or when they are taken to a new area of grazing on the same farm. Animals newly introduced to a district will frequently eat toxic species with which they are unfamiliar. </div> <div> </div> <div>Another cause of stock poisoning is the <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Pollution of organic product or land; or contact with any material that would render the product unsuitable for organic certification. ">contamination</a> of prepared fodder or concentrates with poisonous material which the animal might well recognise and avoid in its natural state. In addition certain foodstuffs which are harmless if fed in reasonable amounts, are toxic if fed as the main article of diet. Aflatoxin containing feedstuffs are also a risk.</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div style="clear: both;"><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div class="file file-image file-image-jpeg" id="file-62359--2"> <div class="content"> <img alt="Signs of poisoning in animals" class="media-element file-default img-responsive" data-delta="1" height="480" src="../sites/default/files/styles/large/public/animal_health/livestock_health/food_poisoningf215.jpg?itok=JSyPd8gj" title="Signs of poisoning in animals" width="445"><div class="field field-name-field-captionimgas field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>Signs of poisoning in animals</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-img-copyright field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>(c) Forse 1999</p> </div></div></div> </div> </div> </div></div> <div style="clear: both;"> </div> <div style="clear: both;"> </div> <div style="clear: both;"> <p> </p> <h3>Prevention of plant poisoning</h3> <p>You can help to stop animals getting poisoned by:</p> <ul><li>Making sure animals are well fed and healthy. Healthy well fed animals are much less likely to eat poisonous plants or scavenge for food and eat poisons by mistake.</li> <li>Do not graze animals where you know there are poisonous plants</li> <li>Avoid pastures that have just been fertilised with nitrogen in any form or sprayed with <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Herbicide is a material used specifically to manage and prevent damage caused by weeds.

Different plants act in different ways and therefore produce different symptoms. Diagnosis often has to rest on the history as frequently symptoms and lesions are rarely characteristic. The fact that animals had access to a particular plant or been seen to be eating it, the presence of identifiable fragments in the stomach and the fact that the animals were strangers to the district should be taken into consideration when attempting to reach a diagnosis.</p> <p>It should be noted that most plants with yellow flowering heads are toxic to stock but, unless the grazing is very sparse, they will avoid eating them.</p> <p>Some plants are poisonous at certain stage of growth and not at others. For example potatoes are particularly poisonous after they have turned green on exposure to light. Certain parts of a plant may be safe to eat while other parts may not be safe. </p> <p>Numerous plants have been incriminated as the cause of poisoning in livestock and a few of these are detailed below.</p> <p> </p> <h3>General Diagnosis of Plant Poisoning</h3> <p>This is not easy and may require the assistance of a skilled veterinarian to differentiate the symptoms observed from those of infectious diseases. Plant poisoning is not common but when it does occur it may have devastating effects so rapid diagnosis is vital.</p> <p>If plant poisoning is suspected often there are signs of gastrointestinal involvement. The gut should be inspected to see if any pieces of plant can be identified.<br>The sudden death of newly introduced animals may arouse suspicion of plant poisoning. Certain plant poisonings may be more common during times of drought when animals may be forced to eat plants they might otherwise avoid.<br><br>Inspection of grazing areas may reveal known toxic plants. When several animals are taken ill at the same time plant poisoning may be suspected.</p> <p><br> </p> <h3>Prevention, Control and Treatment</h3> <p>The most important plank in prevention is by not allowing animals access to plants which may cause poisoning. This may be difficult when the responsible plants are those which may be normally safe to eat at certain stages of growth and not at others. But if there are known poisonous plants in an area these should either be physically removed or animals should not be allowed to graze there. Well fed animals are less likely to sample poisonous plants than animals which are hungry. In times of drought try to supply supplementary feed.</p> <h3><br><br>Treatment</h3> <p>in many cases, in the absence of a specific diagnosis, treatment has to be symptomatic, but if poisoning is suspected any of the following can be tried (adapted from Forse 1999).</p> <ul><li>Giving a purgative, such as Epsom&#39;s salts, may help to remove the toxin from the gut. Give 100g Epsom salt in half litre of water to small animals and up to 500 g Epsom salt in 1 litre of water for large animals given by mouth. Only use about 50 g Epsom salt for horses. Epsom salt (magnesium sulphate) is useful for treating poisoning. It makes more water go into the intestines from the body and gives the animal diarrhea so most of the poison in the intestines mixes with water and comes out as diarrhea.</li> <li>Mix kaolin (fine white clay powder) in water until it is a milky liquid. Give by mouth. For a large animal use about 200g Kaolin for a small animal about 10 g. Give every day for a few days if needed.</li> <li>Mixing a handful of charcoal powder in a bottle of clean water and give the solution by mouth may help in some cases. Charcoal can inactivate poisons in the stomach.</li> <li>Give milk or coconut milk by mouth</li> <li>Mix ground cereals or rice with water and give by mouth</li> <li>Mix 6 eggs and half kilo of sugar with about 1 litre of water and give by mouth.</li> <li>Animals which are depressed may benefit from the administration of stimulants.</li> <li>Animals which are excited may benefit from sedatives.</li> <li>In some cases, eg Prussic Acid Poisoning, or Nitrate/Nitrite Poisoning, there is a specific antidote, but in the majority of plant poisoning there is not and so one has to treat the symptoms as they appear.</li> </ul><p> </p> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-3">Poisonous plants</h2> <p>Numerous plants have been incriminated as the cause of poisoning in livestock and a few of these are detailed below.</p> <h3> </h3> <h3>Acokanthera</h3> <p>These small spreading trees have received much notoriety as being the main provider of many arrow poisons. The leaves are glossy and pointed. Being ever green the tree is attractive to stock when conditions are dry. Although the ripe fruits are edible it may be presumed that all other parts of the tree are poisonous.</p> <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p> <p>In cattle death occurs suddenly, but rapid shallow breathing may be seen together with diarrhoea. Other symptoms include muscular spasms, teeth grinding, grunting respirations, and a profuse, clear, slimy nasal discharge. Post mortem reveals gastroenteritis, pale pink lungs distended with air and haemorrhages within the heart.</p> <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 680px; height: 405px;"><tbody><tr><td> <p></p><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div class="file file-image file-image-png" id="file-62362--2"> <div class="content"> <img alt="Acokanthera Schimperi" class="media-element file-default img-responsive" data-delta="4" height="368" src="../sites/default/files/styles/large/public/animal_health/livestock_health/acokantheracee9.png?itok=l9n-U0hD" style="width: 255px; height: 374px;" title="Acokanthera Schimperi" width="235"><div class="field field-name-field-captionimgas field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p><i>Acokanthera Schimperi</i> </p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-img-copyright field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>(c) Patrick Maundu.

Its importance lies in the fact that poisoning produces symptoms similar to those of Rabies.</p> <p>In the Limuru highland areas very many cases of poisoning have happened due to cows eating wildings of this plant which stay green during the dry season. A few leaves only will kill a grown cow. Affected cows are irritable and hypersensitive to any external stimuli. Sudden sounds or poking with a stick causes affected animals to jump as though they had received an electric shock. On some occasions animals charge with wide open eyes any moving object. Prior to death there may be frequent bellowing followed by paralysis starting at the hindquarters. When opening such a case of poisoning it can be seen that the stomach lining has completely detached from the stomach walls, and it is evident that the death has been very painful.</p> <p>If this tree is common in the neighborhood it is very important to recognize the leaves and uproot any little seedling in the pasture and removing it from the area. Whereas cattle may stay away from a green plant as it is very bitter, the smell of a cut dry plant left in the boma will not give the same warning but the dry plant is equally poisonous.</p> <p> </p> <h3> </h3> <h3>Cotton Seed </h3> <p>Cotton seed contains a toxic substance called Gossypol, which can be poisonous to young ruminants and pigs. This toxin rarely affects adult cattle. It is destroyed by heat. Cotton seed cake which has been produced by heat treatment is therefore safe. But cotton seed is not safe to be given to young ruminants or to pigs. <strong>Clinical signs </strong>do not appear until after animals have been fed rations containing cotton seed for 1-3 months. These include loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, rapid breathing and increased susceptibility to stress. Death may occur. There is <strong>no effective treatment </strong>and in cases of suspected poisoning all cotton seed products should be removed from the diet.</p> <h3><br> </h3> <h3>Crotalaria</h3> <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td> <p></p><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div class="file file-image file-image-gif" id="file-51597--2"> <div class="content"> <img alt="Crotalaria " class="media-element file-default img-responsive" data-delta="16" height="179" src="../sites/default/files/styles/large/public/plant_health/Crotalaria%20Formatkenyaff60.gif?itok=mAotuYr0" title="Crotalaria " width="193"><div class="field field-name-field-captionimgas field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>Crotalaria </p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-img-copyright field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>(c) FORMAT, Kenya</p> </div></div></div> </div> </div> </div> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p>These plants are responsible for causing chronic liver damage and laminitis of the hooves.

There is difficulty in breathing, staggering, tail-twitching, rapid respirations, salivation, muscle twitching, rapid heart rate, collapse and death often within less than half an hour of the onset of symptoms. Death is accompanied by severe asphyxial convulsions. The blood of affected animals is often a bright cherry red as may be the mucous membranes. When the rumen is opened there is often the characteristic smell of &quot;bitter almonds&quot;. This is a very dramatic poisoning, caused not by a particular plant which is inherently poisonous, but by certain pasture plants which under most conditions are not poisonous. Treatment must be immediate and involves the antidotes Sodium Nitrite and Sodium Thiosulphate. The former is given as 10ml of a 20% solution i/v followed by 30mls of a 20% solution of sodium thiosulphate also i/v. Alternatively sodium thiosulphate may be given alone at 500mg/kg i/v plus 30g per cow by mouth to detoxify any remaining hydrocyanic acid in the rumen. If large numbers of animals are affected then speed of treatment may preclude i/v treatment and the following has been found to be effective - mix 3g sodium nitrite and 15g sodium thiosulphate together in 30ml sterile water and give by s/c injection.</p> <p><br><strong>Prevention</strong> involves preventing cattle from grazing potentially dangerous plants such as sorghum when they are immature, frosted, wilted or trampled. Sorghum in particular should be in flower before they are grazed or chopped to be fed green. </p> <h3><br> </h3> <h3>Lantana species</h3> <p>There are various species of this shrub, including the introduced Lantana camara.

">herbicide</a>s.</p> <p>These two may be considered together as the former owe their toxicity to their reduction to the latter by the rumen or intestinal flora. The nitrite is absorbed into the blood stream where it converts the haemoglobin of the blood into methaemoglobin, thereby producing a state of hypoxia. Nitrates occur in numerous plants and their concentration is increased by factors such as climate- damp cloudy conditions, cool temperatures, rapid growth in hot humid weather, concentration of nitrate in the lower part of the plant if stunting occurs due to drought.</p> <p>All species are susceptible to nitrate/nitrite poisoning but cattle are the animals most commonly affected. Poisoning is not so much due to the actual quantity ingested as the rate at which it is consumed. Symptoms are abdominal pain, depression, inco-ordination, diarrhoea, rapid breathing, convulsions, coma and death. Cyanosis may be observed. The outstanding PM finding is the chocolate coloured blood.</p> <p>Treatment is by the I/V injection of methylene blue, 10mg/kg of a 4% solution, repeated as necessary.</p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Urea</strong></h3> <p>Urea poisoning can result from its too liberal use as a food supplement or from its having been unevenly spread on pasture when used as a fertilizer. Sheep and cattle rapidly acquire <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="tolerance ">tolerance</a> to it and can consume unharmed, quantities which would kill an animal unused to it. Urea blocks which are unprotected from the effects of rain or which are soft or crumble easily are especially dangerous.</p> <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> may appear within 20 - 60 minutes in cattle after eating(ingesting) urea. After ingestion in an animal not used to eating urea it releases high amounts of ammonia into the gastrointestinal tract where it is absorbed leading to symptoms of poisoning. These include abdominal pain, muscle tremors, especially of the ears and face, frothy salivation, excess urination and teeth grinding. Cattle are often agitated, aggressive, and violent. Bloat may be evident. There may be bellowing and violent struggling, convulsions, tetanic spasms, rapid breathing and death within 2 hours.</p> <p><strong>Treatment </strong>includes drenching cattle with 2 - 8 litres of 5% acetic acid ( table vinegar) and drenching with iced water - up to 40 litres in cattle and proportionately less in sheep and goats.</p> <p>Urea should be limited to not more than 1% of the total diet and it must always be introduced slowly at a rate which should not be deviated from. While properly adapted cattle can tolerate up to 1G urea/kg (??) bodyweight per day, but it is safer not to exceed half that amount.</p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Salt</strong></h3> <p>Eating excessive quantities of salt causes inflammation of the intestinal tract resulting in gastroenteritis and diarrhoea. When the water intake is also restricted there is swelling of the brain and the production of nervous signs. In Kenya this has been most frequently seen either when there has been a shortage of salt lick or when salt has been introduced to cattle after a lengthy period when the cattle have not had access to salt.</p> <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> in <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period.

Corticosteroids may be used to minimize swelling but must NEVER be used in pregnant animals as they will cause abortion. Antibiotics should be given to minimize infection. Incising the wound or applying tourniquets are of little value and usually too late anyway. Supportive treatment by improving the diet of the patient is essential</p> <p>Success with electric shock in snakebite treatment has been reported: Connect starter cables to the car battery while the car is running and put the other ends close together on the snakebite to create an electric shock. This is reported to neutralize the poison.</p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Arsenic</strong></h3> <p>The most common source of arsenic which may affect stock is old dips in which arsenic was previously used as an acaricide. Arsenic is extremely stable and may remain intact in soil adjacent to an old dip virtually indefinitely. Where cattle have stood following their immersion from the dip to drain is the danger zone. The soil and vegetation may be impregnated with arsenic. Large numbers of animals have died from grazing within the vicinity of these old unfenced dips.

A delay of more than 12 hours is usually fatal.</p> <p><strong>Treatment</strong> is by using Sodium Thiosulphate. This compound is almost completely non-toxic and can be given in large amounts without accurate measurement. Intravenous injection is best as an initial treatment using 15 - 30g. of the salt in 100 - 200ml of water followed by oral dosing of 30 - 60g at 6 hourly intervals. Treatment should be continued until recovery occurs which may take 3 - 4 days.</p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Copper</strong></h3> <p>Cases of <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period.

Likewise low dietary intakes of sulphur and molybdenum may reduce the excretion of copper in the urine or faeces, resulting in chronic copper toxicosis. <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period. ">Acute</a> copper poisoning causes severe gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, salivation, lack of appetite, convulsions, dehydration, shock, collapse and death. Often there is evidence in the faeces of copper as they may be a blue-green colour.</p> <p>&quot;Chronic&quot; copper poisoning is associated with the sudden onset of symptoms associated with the haemolytic crisis. These include depression, lack of appetite, weakness, <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Resting on the surface from which it arises. Used of an organ or other structure. ">recumbency</a>, thirst, rapid breathing, pale mucous membranes, blood in the urine and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Yellowish discoloration of the whites of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes caused by deposition of bile salts in these tissues. It occurs as a symptom of various diseases, such as hepatitis, that affect the processing of bile. Also called icterus. ">jaundice</a>. Most affected animals die within 1-2 days. Losses may continue for several months after the dietary problem has been rectified.</p> <p>Post mortem there is severe gastroenteritis in <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period. ">acute</a> copper poisoning, and liver, kidney and splenic damage in &quot;chronic&quot; copper poisoning together with port-wine coloured urine. Often treatment is unsuccessful due to the nature of the damage inflicted by the copper. In addition the recommended drugs for treatment are generally unavailable.</p> <p>Plants which induce copper retention should be eradicated. The top dressing of pastures with molybdenum or adding molybdenum to the diet of lambs has been shown to greatly reduce the uptake of copper by the liver.</p> <h3> </h3> <h3><strong>Lead</strong></h3> <p>Lead poisoning is, fortunately, not common in Kenya . Cattle and dogs are the species most usually affected. Paint, especially when it is old and flaking, old car batteries, lead shot, lead weights, putty and red lead are the most common sources of lead. Poisoning may be either <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period. ">acute</a> or chronic, but there is no clear demarcation between the two. <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period. ">Acute</a> lead poisoning in cattle is more common in young animals. The most common symptoms are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system. Signs that appear within 24-48 hours of exposure include staggering, blindness, salivation, spastic twitching of the eyelids, jaw champing, muscle tremors, excitement and convulsions. Death may occur within a few hours of the onset of symptoms.</p> <p>Subacute lead poisoning in cattle is characterized by lack of appetite, stasis of the rumen, colic, dullness, transient constipation, frequently followed by diarrhoea, blindness, head pressing, hyperesthesia and incoordination.</p> <p>Post mortem may reveal flakes of lead in the gastrointestinal tract. There may be gastroenteritis, degenerative changes in the liver and kidney but often the finding are not dramatic. Diagnosis may be confirmed by chemical analysis of the liver and kidneys of dead animals or the blood and urine of the living. The lack of laboratory facilities may present problems, as may treatment, as the usual antidote, calcium disodium edetate is unlikely to be available. Thiamine has been found to be helpful in alleviating clinical signs and reducing tissue deposition of lead. Epsom salts may help in removing lead from the gastrointestinal tract. Preventing animals from accessing lead, therefore, is all important in avoiding poisoning.</p> <h3> </h3> <h3><strong>Organophosphate insecticides</strong></h3> <p>This includes most dips available in the market today. They can get into the animal through mouth or through the skin. Also some of the insecticides used in agriculture are of this nature.</p> <p><strong>Signs</strong> of organophosphate poisoning:</p> <ul><li>The animals behave unusually. They often stagger about and have tremors or twitches under the skin</li> <li>Much saliva comes from the mouth and a clear discharge comes from the eyes and eyes have very small pupils</li> <li>Animals have pain in the stomach. They do not eat much. Some animals may vomit. They may urinate more than usual.</li> <li>Breathing becomes distressed</li> </ul><p>They soon become paralyzed, collapse and die.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Treatment</strong></p> <p>Has to start immediately in order to save the animal: Wash the animal with water and soap. If poison may have been swallowed give charcoal powder. If the vet is near ask to have the animal given an injection of Atropine sulphate (0.4 mg/kg under the skin).</p> </div> </div> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-5">Review Process</h2> <ol><li>Draft By William <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Ayako">Ayako</span>, Aug - Dec 2009</li> <li>Review by Hugh <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Cran">Cran</span> March 2010 - Jan 2011</li> <li>Review workshop team.
