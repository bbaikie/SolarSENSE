If the fodder production of one&#39;s farm is limited (which usually is the case), it might be economically valid to keep less animals but supply them with sufficient food. The appropriate quantity and the mix of feed items will of course depend on the type of animal, but also on its main use (e.g. chicken for meat or egg production, cattle for milk, meat or draft etc.). In milk production for example, cows producing milk should be given fresh grass and possibly other feed items of sufficient protein content. On the same diet, draught animals would rapidly become exhausted.</p> <p>A balanced diet will keep an animal healthy and productive. Whether or not a farm animal receives the appropriate amount and kind of fodder usually can be seen by the shine of its hair or feathers.For ruminants, a majority of the fodder should consist of roughage (grass, leaves). If concentrates or supplements are used (e.g. agricultural by-products and wastes), they should not contain growth promoters and other <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Manufactured by chemical and industrial processes.

Instead of buying expensive concentrates, there are a variety of leguminous plants rich in protein which can be grown in the farm as cover crop, hedges or trees. If mineral content in the available fodder is not sufficient to satisfy the animal&#39;s requirements, mineral salt bricks or similar feed supplements can be used as long as they do not contain <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Manufactured by chemical and industrial processes.

But keeping animals means providing fodder throughout the year. Fodder can be produced on the farm as grazing land or as grass or tree crops used for cutting. While grazing requires less labour than shed feeding, more land is needed and appropriate measures to keep the animals away from other crops must be undertaken. Grazing may lead to a lower productivity (milk, meat) but usually is the more favourable option concerning health and welfare of the animals. Shed keeping, however, has the advantage that the dung can be easily collected, stored, or composted and applied to the crops. Whether grazing or shed feeding is the more suitable option will mainly depend on the agro-climatic conditions, the cropping system, and the availability of land. A combination of shed feeding and grazing in a fenced area may be an ideal combination of high productivity and animal friendly husbandry. In extensive grass lands of semi-arid areas, however, grazing may be the only suitable option. </p> <div style="clear:both;"> </div> <div style="clear:both;"> <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/2060.400x300.jpg" style="border:0px none white;"></td> </tr><tr><td>The pros and cons of grazing and shed feeding, and the combination of both systems as a promising option</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) IFOAM Training Manual for Organic Farming in the Tropics</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <h3><strong>Integrating fodder cultivation in the farm</strong></h3> <p> In most smallholder farms, fodder cultivation will compete for space with the cultivation of crops. Whether fodder cultivation (and thus animal husbandry) is economically more beneficial compared with crop production must be assessed case by case. However, there are some options for integrating fodder crops in farms without sacrificing much land. Below are some examples:</p> </div> <ul><li>Grass or leguminous cover crops in tree plantations</li> <li>Hedges of suitable shrubs</li> <li>Shade or support trees</li> <li>Grass on bunds against soil erosion</li> <li>Grass fallows or <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="A crop grown before or between the main crop rows, cut before maturation and subsequently ploughed in or used as mulch. It provides nutrients to the main crop through decomposition and helps to build up humus in the soil. ">green manure</a>s in the crop rotation</li> <li>Crops with by-products such as paddy straw or pea leaves</li> </ul><p> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Pasture management </strong></h3> <p>The management of pastures is crucial for a good herd management. It is also important to practice appropriate management throughout the year. There are many different types of grasses, and every climatic region has grasses which are specifically adapted to the conditions. In some cases it may be worth considering to till the grazing site and sow grass varieties that are more appropriate to the animal&#39;s needs.</p> <p>Overgrazing is probably the most significant threat to grass land. Once the protective grass cover is destroyed, the top soil is prone to erosion. Degraded pastures or land with little plant cover is difficult to re-cultivate. Therefore, it is important that the use and intensity of grazing on a particular piece of land is appropriate to its production capacity. Sufficient time must be given to a pasture to recover after intensive grazing. Fencing off of areas and rotation of the grazing animals on several pieces of land is a suitable option. This will also reduce infection from parasites encountered while the animals graze. </p> <p>The intensity and timing of grazing as well as the cutting of the grass will influence the varieties of plants growing in the pasture. If certain weeds are a problem, the organic farmer will have to change his management practises as <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Herbicide is a material used specifically to manage and prevent damage caused by weeds. ">herbicide</a>s can not be used. </p> <p> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Rehabilitation of pastures</strong> </h3> <p>Rehabilitate pasture land with improved grass varieties and legumes for higher yield, higher nutritive value and palatability. Grasses can be transplanted or grown from seed. Legume seeds are sown between grass lines. Multipurpose trees can also be planted to provide fodder, fuel and timber.</p> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-4">Fodder and pasture production (for ruminants)</h2> <div> <div>Dairy cattle are ruminants, whose production all over the world are primarily based on forages, with tropical countries invariably leading in heavy reliance on forages and crop residues throughout the year. For instance, majority of dairy herds on smallholder farms in Kenya, largely depend on natural tropical grass pastures and crop residues for nourishment. Kenya and indeed the whole of East African region is widely recognized as the home for many important forages. <div> </div> <div>Pasture leys and fodder (forage) crops are either annuals, perennials, or permanent crops. They are cultivated on arable land and are grazed or cut and fed to the livestock either green or conserved in the form of hay or silage. They are usually grown in rotation with cultivated cash crops. Their high productivity and quality per unit area makes them appropriate for small-scale farmers because they provide them with</div> <p>(a) Immediate feeding material for the livestock especially in a zero-grazing system. </p> <p>(b) Surplus material which can be conserved in form of hay or silage for dry season feeding. The role played by pasture legumes as a feed should also be emphasized because of their high protein content and the fact that they fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil. Table 2 shows major pasture leys and fodder crops suitable for different Kenyan Agro-ecological zones.</p> <div>It is advisable to make a feeding plan which covers the whole year with allowances for missed rainy seasons. This means storing hay, straw, silage whenever it can be available. Good quality and well stored feed always comes in handy when the rains delay or fail.

There is risk of frost at times so sensitive crops like maize are usually not attempted on a large scale. Good fodder production plans include grasses and legumes as listed below, which can be either cut and carried, grazed (Lucerne does not like being grazed by animals) or made into hay or silage. For grass pastures it is usually a good idea to fence off part of the grazing area early in the rainy season, and let the grass in fenced in plots grow tall for hay making, while the cows graze the rest.

Lucerne (<em>Medicago sativa</em>)</strong></h3> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>Uses/applications</strong> </div> <p>Lucerne was one of the first forage crops to be domesticated. It is used as multi-purpose forage, able to be used for both grazing and conservation (hay, silage, meal and forage dehydration). It can be sown as a pure stand or in mixtures with both temperate and tropical grasses. The seed can also be used for human consumption as sprouts. </p> <p> </p> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>Moisture</strong></div> <p>Lucerne is a crop, which is relatively drought tolerant and will produce yields about in proportion to the water supply. In periods of drought, it will adjust plant density to cope with the availability of water supply. Its taproot is capable of following water supply to considerable depths (up to 8 m, but more commonly 2-3 m).

Protein and calcium levels are high, relative to other fodders, but metabolizable energy (ME) and phosphorus levels are low. ME and phosphorus levels are good in young growth but drop rapidly as the foliage matures. Intake of digestible nutrients by livestock is higher than for most other forages. Level of fibrous tissue is low and this allows rapid passage through the rumen . Lucerne foliage is highly digestible.</p> <p> </p> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>Palatability/acceptability</strong> </div> <p>Lucerne is highly palatable. There are some <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Cultivar is a plant variety.

">cultivar</a> differences in palatability and this is thought to be the result of different protein fractionations.</p> <p> </p> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>Toxicity</strong> </div> <p>Bloat is the major limitation to grazing lucerne. A combination of management and control measures can be used to reduce the risk of animals bloating on lucerne. Hungry animals are more at risk of bloat so provide animals with access to a source of roughage before or during grazing. There is usually reduced risk of bloat in mixed stands under rain grown conditions. Access to anti-bloating agents (drenching, in their water supply, rumen capsules or sprayed on foliage) is essential in intensively grazed situations. Enterotoxaemia can be a problem with sheep. This can be controlled by injections. </p> <p> </p> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>Production potential </strong></div> <p><strong>Dry matter</strong> </p> <p>Under irrigation, lucerne is capable of producing 25-27 t/ha dry matter in the first year of a stand and this can fall to as little as 8-15 t/ha by the third year.

Supplementing dairy cows grazing tropical grasses with lucerne can raise milk production from 10-12 to 14-15 L/cow/day. This can increase to 20 L/cow/day if the cows are further supplemented with grain to combat the energy deficiency.

Although this native environment mostly does not have a pronounced dry season, the grass has become naturalised in areas with a distinct 5 month dry season. Where soils are suitable, it has become naturalised in areas with rainfall up to 3000 mm and down to 800 mm/yr, and performing well under irrigation in lower rainfall areas. It is moderately drought tolerant, because of deep root system (to &gt;3 m. Most active growth occurs during periods of high humidity. Regular cutting or grazing is necessary to maintain forage quality and palatability of the stand. Management should aim to maximise the amount of leaf, and minimise the amount of stem. Accordingly, stands should be grazed to about 5 cm in height and allowed to regrow to about 15 cm. If pasture height exceeds 15 cm, it is best to mow the sward back to 5 cm to remove stems and mature growth. If well fertilised, kikuyu is very tolerant of constant heavy grazing, although productivity is reduced under such management. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Establishment:</strong></p> <p>Kikuyu is readily established vegetatively or from seed. Harvested pieces of stolon or <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="A plant stem that grows horizontally under or along the ground and often sends out roots and shoots. New plants develop from the shoots. ">rhizome</a> can be planted on a regular grid, or broadcast and cultivated into the soil surface. Subsequent rolling ensures better establishment.

Good moisture conditions for several days after sowing are essential for effective establishment.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Yield and utilization: </strong></p> <p>DM yields are only limited by soil fertility and moisture availability. Under optimum conditions, it is capable of producing 30 t/ha/yr, but is unproductive if not fertilised. Responses of the order of 15 to 30 kg DM per kg N applied are reported. Kikuyu is particularly demanding for N and P. While other nutrients are also essential, historically it has been decline in soil N and P levels that has led to decline in formerly productive stands. Renovation of &#39;run-down&#39; kikuyu grass should include incorporation of a legume or the use N and P fertiliser. Young growth is very soft and palatable, but older growth is not relished by most animals. The presence of a legume in the sward increases utilisation of the kikuyu. Well-fertilised kikuyu produces very high quality feed with over 25% CP and over 70% digestibility in young leaf. CP levels tend to stay high for 1 or 2 weeks and then decline rapidly, to below 10% within 12 weeks. Digestibility also falls to &lt;50% in the same period. For good silage fermentation, kikuyu needs to be wilted first or have extra sugar added because of its low DM and low water soluble carbohydrate content.Well fertilised pastures are capable of carrying 1.5 to 3.0 adult cattle/ha.

It can be intercropped with grasses, maize etc. It can also be utilised as hedge plantation around agricultural lands, homesteads etc. Number of seed per kg is 16000. Sowing rate is about 20-25 kg/ha. For strip planting, sow at a rate of lkg/km of strip.No treatment of seed is necessary even if inoculation improves initial performance. The Pigeon pea has a short life span and should be replanted after 4-5 years. It does not persist if heavily grazed. For cut forage, it should be topped at a height of about 80 cm. The plants should be allowed to develop well before cutting. It can be cut 2-3 times during growing season.

In many cases natural pasture has been eradicated by overgrazing and land degradation has set in as a result. Overgrazing puts the balance between grass and bushes to the bush side. Bush or <em>shrub encroachment </em>can finally finish the grazing potential. <em>shrub encroachment,</em> in its first stage has poisonous or bitter herbs establishing and thrive abundantly, which are not eaten by livestock, leading to some sort of &quot;green degradation&quot;. In AEZ 6 (see agro-ecological zones) the eradication of grass by overgrazing promotes at first dwarf shrubs (dwarf shrub encroachment), then in the better subzones thorny low shrubs grow up. The grazing potential has severely decreased, only goats as browsers remain. In a final stage, due to overuse and soil denudation, the shrubs disappear and desertification becomes evident. Reseeding fenced plots before it is so bad is now practised. Another problem that is aggravating not only the cropland but even the grazing land is soil degradation.

It consists of sowing seed in a fine, firm and weed-free seedbed. Pasture should be sown into land that has been under crop for 2 or more years. For example Lucerne which is slow to germinate, is often sown together with barley or oats (undersowing).

In bimodal rainfall areas sowing is preferred in the short rains so that annual weeds are soon eliminated.</li> <li>Seeds should be sown close to the surface in order to get in contact with moist soil so as to enhance germination. Seeds should not be buried deeply since initial vigour is not sufficient to push through a heavy cap of soil.</li> <li>Grass seeds can either be broadcasted or drilled in rows 30-40 cm apart.</li> <li>Mix the seeds with saw-dust, rough sand or phosphate fertilizer for even distribution. It is not recommended to sow grass or lucerne seeds mixed with the fertilizer as scorching of seed by the fertilizer can easily occur.</li> <li>Sowing of grass seeds is effectively done with a wheat drill. Hand sowing is recommended for smaller acreages where close supervision and attention to details is possible.</li> <li>Immediately after sowing, the seedbed should be compacted to enhance germination of the grass seed by improving contact with the soil. This can be done by use of tree branches or even by trampling by foot on small plots. In mechanized farms a roller can be used.</li> </ul><p> </p> <h3><strong>Fertilizer used at planting</strong></h3> <div>Use phosphate fertilizer or <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Droppings and beddings of farm animals, usually of cattle.

Pasture establishment involves a considerable investment and returns depend on how efficiently the pasture can be managed and converted into milk or meat. Things to look into are:- </p> <p>a) weed control</p> <p>b) grazing management</p> <p>c) fertility management</p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Weed control</strong></h3> <div>Weeds can reduce the productivity of the sown pastures particularly during the establishment year. Therefore:-</div> <ul><li>Control weeds during the first year by either (a) hand weeding or (b) by use of <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Herbicide is a material used specifically to manage and prevent damage caused by weeds. ">herbicide</a> In subsequent years, keep fields clean by slashing, hand pulling or mowing of weeds.</li> </ul><p> </p> <h3>Grazing management</h3> <p>During the establishment year grasses reach early flowering stage 3-4 months after planting. At this stage the plant is not firmly anchored in the soil and therefore it is usually advisable to make hay rather than graze the pastures to avoid the risk of the cattle pulling out the young shoots. </p> <ul><li>If grazing must be done during the establishment year, it should be light enough to enable the plant to establish firmly in the soil.</li> <li>For maximum benefits use the pasture not later than the start of flowering stage.

Some of the more common deficiencies are copper, cobalt and selenium deficiencies, but also nitrogen, phosphorous and potassion deficiencies are common. If your pastures do not look green and healthy during rainy seasons, it will pay to get a soil sample analyzed to see what is missing. Any deficiency can severely lower the production of pastures and cropland. </p> <p> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Production and management of fodder trees and shrubs</strong></h3> <div style="clear:both;"> </div> <div><strong>Management of Multipurpose tree for forage production</strong></div> <p>Production of seedlings and planting techniques are practices well known by farmers in Ethiopia. Therefore, this manual will not deal on these issues. The problem related to forage trees are those observed after they are planted out in the field. There are certain simple but very critical management techniques, which should be applied to maximise the foliage yield from fodder trees. Weeding is an essential cultural practice in the establishment process of fodder trees to which little attention is given. Weeding is often not done because the benefits from the practice is least understood by farmers! Moreover, it is also given less priority owing to the fact that other pressing work in the agricultural calendar, demand much of the farmer&#39;s labour and time. </p> <p> </p> <div><strong>Weeding: </strong></div> <ul><li>minimises the competition for moisture and nutrients thereby boosting early growth and vigour of the seedlings. </li> <li>reduces the risk of fire </li> <li>facilitates percolation of water and soil aeration necessary for proper plant development. </li> <li>In forestry areas bare soil accumulate heat during the day releasing it at night. This reduces frost damage in frost prone areas </li> </ul><p> </p> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>1. Weeding</strong> </div> <p>The trees should enter the dry season completely free from feed. </p> <p> </p> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>2. Application of manure </strong></div> <p>Wherever possible application of manure helps in the recycle of soil nutrients. The replenished soil nutrients secure fast growth and an increase in high quality fodder production. It is recommended that, manure should be applied on land used for growing forage trees during rainy season, If applied in dry period it should be well watered to improve its utilisation by the plants. </p> <p> </p> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>3. Protection of young trees </strong></div> <p>Newly planted multiple purpose tree (MPT) seedlings and young trees are very sensitive to damage by animals and have to be protected against livestock. In general, MPT and cultivated forage crops should be protected from livestock in similar ways as much as is done for any cash crop during the establishment period. &quot;i&#39;rces need protection from livestock in the first 2 - 3 years of establishment. In many highland farming areas livestock are herded in the rainy season to prevent damages to crops but are left free to graze during the dry season (post harvest time). It is during the dry season that heavy damage is inflicted to seedlings through browsing and trampling,</p> <p>The most common way to protect trees against livestock is by fencing. Various materials can be used for fencing. The best is the easiest available and most inexpensive local materials such as thorny branches, sticks and poles.</p> <p>Live fences can also be used by planting Euphorbia and other non palatable species or thorny species like Erithryna as protection. This method is more permanent and requires less maintenance and labour than when using fencing material. Controlled rotational grazing, introduction of fodder banks and zero grazing system are also practices that can help in replacing the loose traditional post harvest grazing which is the cause to the damage of planted fodder trees. </p> <p> </p> <div style="clear:both;"><strong>4. Harvesting of fodder trees </strong></div> <p>In the establishment of multipurpose trees for forage production it is critical to identify and use the most suitable species for adaptation for the different agro ecological zones. Likewise, for high quality optimal yield of forage from planted fodder trees proper harvesting techniques should be used so that the leafy portion is higher than the stemy portion in the biomass harvested. Fodder trees need to be harvested timely and regularly for higher and sustainable yield. It must also be understood that there are different harvesting method for the different fodder species. Thus, as fodder species are specific to the harvesting method they require, one should learn and know the methods that are practised under different circumstances. </p> <p> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Coppicing</strong></h3> <p>Coppicing is cutting the stem or back of a tree at height of 10 - 50 cm from the ground to stimulate production of new shoots, When carrying out coppicing, the following points must be observed: </p> <ul><li>the cut should be at angle </li> <li>the bark should not be damaged </li> <li>only the best shoot should be left when arising from the new stump, when reaching a length of approximate. 1 m. </li> <li>young coppice should be kept weed free </li> <li>coppicing should be done in the early rainy season </li> </ul><p>Species suitable for fodder production and being promoted by SDDP to contract farmers are not good at coppicing and might even die if they are cut too low. They are more suitable for pollarding and side pruning Species used by SDDP, which can stand coppicing, are Calliandra and L.leucocephala. They are both lower altitude species. </p> <p> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Pollarding </strong></h3> <p>Pollarding is cutting back of the crown at a height of 1.5 to 2 m. The main purpose of pollarding are to harvest the branches and leaves to stimulate growth of a new palatable fresh leaves to get well formed productive crown to reduce negative shading effects on the adjacent crops. When pollarding is carried out to maximise the production of fodder, it is better to pollard lower down the tree to facilitate access. Not all species can withstand pollarding. Species which can withstand pollarding and promoted by SDDP are <em>Grevillae robusta</em> and <em>Erythrina abyssinica</em>. </p> <p> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Side pruning </strong></h3> <div>This is the removal of lower branches from the tree. Side pruning is mainly done to: </div> <ul><li>reduce shade on the agricultural branches </li> <li>harvest the branches for fodder, fuelwood etc. </li> </ul><div>In intercropping system, side pruning should be done before or at the beginning of the cropping season in order to minimise shade on the crop. Pruning should be done in a declining angle with a sharp toll (strokes) in order to allow water to run off and thus minimise the risk for fungal attacks. The branches should be cut 2-3 cm from the stem. Pruning should be straight from the bottom and then move upwards. </div> <div> </div> <div>The management of fodder trees in the SDDP project area should focus on maximising leaf production to safeguard and maximise the availability of feed during the dry season. The fodder species should not be cut too low. In general, a cutting height of minimum 1.2 -1.5 m is recommendable and they should be given a chance to get established properly before cutting.</div> <div> </div> <div>Sesbania is best cut before it is year old and should thereafter be cut at a height of approximately 1 m. Leucaeana, Calliandra and Tagasaste should be cut at a height above 1.2 meter. Some experiments have however shown that Leuceana produces most biomass when cut at a height of 3 meter.</div> <div> </div> <div>Unless fodder trees are cut, they will never produce much leaves for fodder. For more foliage production forage the trees have to be managed correctly and be cut regularly. Sesbania is usually not a good producer of leafy biomass.The manure or slurry from a biogas facility should be applied around the trees to assure good growth and improve nitrogen content of the trees. There is a substantial difference in nitrogen contents in fertilised and unfertilised trees.</div> <p>Of the fodder trees mentioned in this manual, Tree Lucerne, <em>Cajanus cajan </em>and <em>Leuceana </em>have been widely accepted by farmers. <em>Sesbania </em>is accepted despite the fact that its low leafy biomass production. However for water logged black cotton soil, Sesbania is still one of the best fodder trees. <em>Calliandra calothyrsus</em> has so far been a disappointment when it comes to production and should not yet be promoted to farmers. <em>Leuceana pallida</em> is mentioned as one possible variety to promote as it performs better than <em>Leuceana leucocephala</em> on lower rainfall areas 500 -1000 mrn and because of its&#39; ability to withstand drought.</p> <p> </p> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item even"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-11">Information Source Links</h2> <div> <div> <ul><li>Ouda JO (2001).
