data-scayt-word="Brucellosis">Brucellosis</span> is an infectious disease caused by the <em><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Brucella">Brucella</span></em> bacteria. There are many other infectious abortions. But most labs in the country/region routinely only diagnose few causes of abortion other than <em><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Brucella">Brucella</span></em> (e.g. caused by bacteria or parasites such as <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Campylobacter">Campylobacter</span>, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Trichomonas">Trichomonas</span>). However, close observation and submitting a full history together with the samples will help alert the lab on the possible involvement of other abortion agents (e.g. Rift Valley Fever).<br><br>Severe general infections of the pregnant dam that cause high fever such as <strong><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Anaplasmosis">Anaplasmosis</span>, East Coast Fever, Pox </strong>and <strong><a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period.

Very early abortion when the embryo is not yet fully developed and is invisible to the naked eye is called <em>early embryonic death</em>. Most cases of <em>abortion</em> occur later during pregnancy; the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="foetus">foetus</span> looks like a miniature calf but is not developed enough to live. In <em>stillbirth</em> the mother expels a fully developed calf that died before it was born (clear sign: it does not even attempt to breathe).<br><br>Single isolated cases of abortion can occur for many reasons and do not always require laboratory diagnosis.

Some become permanent carriers, while others appear to be resistant to infection. In young bulls, less than 3-4 years of age, infection tends to be temporary, with transmission apparently relying on sexual contact with a non-infected cow within minutes to days of breeding with an infected cow. Spontaneous clearance in these younger bulls does not seem to be related to any immune response and so re-infection can readily occur.

Although most of the genital tract may be free of infection, when a cow eventually conceives the vagina may remain chronically infected throughout pregnancy.</div> <div>Some infected females can maintain pregnancy but abort usually around the fifth month of pregnancy or sometimes earlier. This means that the presence of the disease can go un-noticed without proper herd fertility records.

The embryonic death initiates cyclical activity in the ovary but these cycles are often irregular with prolonged intervals. Observed abortions are uncommon.</div> <div>Clinical signs in herds for which good records are maintained are soon evident shortly after the introduction of an infected bull.
