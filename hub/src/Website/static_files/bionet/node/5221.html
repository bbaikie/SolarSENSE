Various beneficial organisms that can help the farmer to keep pests (and some diseases) under control and prevent them from causing economic damage.</div> <p>Areas of land which have not been cultivated or disturbed contain hundreds or thousands of species which tend to form a balance, with each of them depending on some of the others. Although large outbreaks of plant-eating pests do sometimes occur in natural systems, any one particular species is less likely to build up a large population if the organisms which feed on it are also present - in other words, its <strong>natural enemies.</strong> </p> <p><br><strong><a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">Predator</a>s</strong> are one type of natural enemies which tend to keep the population of their prey in check. They catch and eat other insects and mites, including pest species. <strong>Parasitoids</strong> are another type of natural enemies. They lay eggs in or on other species of insect (called hosts) and the larval stage kills the host as it feeds on it and develops. The third major group of farmers&#39; friends is <strong>pathogens</strong>. These are fatal or debilitating diseases to arthropod pests and include <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Occurring worldwide, most fungi are largely invisible to the naked eye, living for the most part in soil, dead matter, and as symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi.

These so-called natural enemies can be conserved by taking care with farming practices so that they are not killed or are actually encouraged. If numbers of such biocontrol agents are still not sufficient to keep pests at acceptable levels, it is possible to release additional beneficial organisms of the same type - a process known as augmentation or inundation. Farmers who collect ladybird beetles in field margins and release them on their crop are practising <strong>augmentation</strong>. Alternatively if suitable types of beneficial organisms are not present in the crop, they can be introduced. Where introduction involves a local beneficial organism which has simply not yet reached a particular crop, this is known as<strong> inoculation</strong>. If the introduced beneficial organism is from outside the area (typically from the country or area where the troublesome pest originated) and becomes established as the controlling factor for the pest in the new area, it is known as <strong>classical biological control</strong>. A new balance is created so that the pest becomes less important.<br> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>How farmers can help to keep the balance</strong></h3> <p>Farmers can help to keep the balance in their favour in trying not to harm <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>y arthropods such as ladybirds, spiders and hover fly larvae which feed on plant-eating pests such as aphids and caterpillars. Some of the ways to do this are:</p> <ul><li>Use control pesticide products only when necessary and then not broad spectrum ones (note that most botanical pesticides are broad spectrum) </li> <li>If control products are used - use them selectively </li> <li>Growing flowering plants which provide nectar and pollen to farmers&#39; friends such as adult parasitoid wasps, hover-flies and ladybird beetles adults by having living fences (hedges) around the crop to provide shelter and refuge for farmers&#39; friends should be encouraged.

">predator</a>y beetles <br> </li> </ul><h3><strong>Conservation of natural enemies</strong></h3> <p>When crops are grown, it inevitably disturbs the natural balance, especially where the crop is a monoculture i.e. all one species of plant. However, the beneficial effect of <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s and parasitoids continue to be critically important. If they are correctly managed, they will help prevent some of the pest problems which farmers encounter. An example of how farmers can help to keep the balance in their favour is to try not to harm <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects.

These <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s can be found on most crops together with parasitoid wasps (and occasionally parasitoid flies) which lay their eggs in/on pests. In <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="A combination of chemical and biological control methods, based on the concept of economic tresholds. Pest management in organic farming uses many biological control methods developed as par of IPM. ">IPM</a> systems which aim to minimise dependence on pesticides, it is essential that the farmer can distinguish these natural enemies from pests and can use farming techniques which will conserve and encourage natural enemies.<br><br>Like humans, insects also suffer from diseases which can weaken or kill them. Types of fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens which only infect insects and are safe for humans and animals have been identified. Some of these are commercially produced as bio-pesticides and some can be prepared on the farm. <br><br> </p> <h3><strong>Augmentation and inundation with natural enemies</strong></h3> <p>Sometimes there are <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s and other natural enemies present which are feeding on the pests, but they are not able to control them effectively, particularly those pests that are capable of breeding very quickly. Farmers can augment the number of natural enemies by bringing them in from outside the field, for example, ladybird beetles or parasitised aphids which contain young parasitoids. Some types of natural enemies can be specially bred in large numbers, and then released onto the crop in order to attack and control the pest. The natural enemies inundate the pest population. Many of the advances in this technique have been against pests of crops which have been economically important for a long time, such as cotton. For example, the egg parasitoid wasp called <em>Trichogramma</em> has been bred in laboratories to allow huge numbers to be released when eggs of the African bollworm are present on the crop. The same bollworm can be a serious pest of tomatoes, so it may be possible to use the same biocontrol tactics developed for cotton. Aphid parasitoids could theoretically be produced and released in a similar way, but these technologies are often not yet available to small-scale vegetable growers.<br><br> </p> <h3><strong>Using insect pathogens in pest control sprays</strong> </h3> <p>Naturally-occurring pathogens (<a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Occurring worldwide, most fungi are largely invisible to the naked eye, living for the most part in soil, dead matter, and as symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi.

Pathogen-based sprays are not yet widely available for vegetable pests except for Bt (<em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>) a bacterium which kills larvae of moths and butterflies (caterpillars). One example under development is a virus which kills diamondback moth caterpillars - a serious pest of brassicas. The pathogen is called <em>Plutella xylostella granulovirus</em> (PlxyGV). The pathogen has the important advantage of being highly specific. In other words it does not harm other arthropods such as natural enemies so it works together with the natural processes which limit pest numbers. This contrasts with most pesticides which also kill natural enemies. Farmers sometimes use a type of home-made biopesticide - they gather diseased pests, crush and mix them with water, then spray the liquid onto the crop.

Reasons for this can be: <br><br><strong>Monocultures:</strong> Planting of large tracts of land with one single crop type is referred to as monoculture.

Various studies have shown that many farmers (and also many agricultural professionals) are not good at insect identification and know little about insect biology and behaviour. In vegetable pest management, if farmers cannot distinguish between pests and friends, they will be likely to use pesticides against any insect observed in the field. They do not want to risk having living things crawling over their crop and so resort to spraying. <br><br>Although proper identification of pests and beneficials is important it is not always easy. Take for instance ladybird beetles, which are one of the most talked about and valuable farmers&#39; friends because of their ability to eat large numbers of plant sucking aphids. But some ladybird species do eat plants and can cause crop damage! These species usually look dusty or slightly hairy - as compared with the very shiny species which are usually farmer&#39;s friends. To make matters more difficult, most insects look very different at different stages in their development. For example, ladybird larvae look like tiny spotted crocodiles and are very different from the adults, but they also eat many aphids, scales and young caterpillars. This highlights the importance of being able to identify that &quot;good and bad&quot; on the crop no matter what life cycle stage is present.<br> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Insect Life Cycles</strong></h3> <p>Most crop pests are arthropods, which means they have external skeletons and jointed legs. Within this group, there are insects which have 6 legs as adults and mites which have 8 legs as adults (but 6 legs when younger). Arthropods are usually considered to be pests if they eat any part of the crop plant (chewing pests) or if they suck crop plant juices (sucking pests). The damage may be caused by adults or by the younger stages called larvae or in some cases nymphs. Other serious pests of vegetables include nematodes, tiny worms that live in and feed on plant roots (plant parasites) and larger animals such as rats, monkeys and even hippos.</p> <h3><br><strong>Life stages of arthropods</strong> </h3> <p>Arthropods can look very different at different stages in their life cycle. It is useful to understand these different forms so that pests can be identified regardless of the stage they have reached in their life cycle. Arthropods go through a process called metamorphosis which means change of form. Some have complete metamorphosis where the young stages look completely different from the adults - see the butterfly in the left hand picture below. Others go through incomplete metamorphosis where the young look a little like small versions of the adult, but without fully developed wings - see the bug in the right hand picture below.</p> <div style="clear: both;"> </div> <table style="width: 100%; line-height: normal;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/2196.500x400.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Insect Life Cycles</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) agLearn.net</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p>So how to make a correct identification? One good source of information is the local extension office which should have field guides and pest and disease identification guides on local problems. Sometimes such guides are also available at universities or colleges and more and more such information is available through the Internet. If you know of any good ones be sure and share the information with other stakeholders, particularly farmers. <br><br>It is also possible to find out whether an organism is a friend or a pest by setting up an <strong>insect zoo </strong>to investigate what the organism is doing on the crop. This involves putting the insect in a small jar together with leaves from that plant and any known pests which were also on that leaf. If it eats or sucks the leaves, it is a pest and if it eats the pests it is a natural enemy.</p> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-body-phmulfi field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-4">Biological Control Methods</h2> <p>Biological control is the process of pest management by the use of living organisms that prey on or attack pests.

These ants are present in many countries in Africa. They are common in the coastal regions in East Africa. They built nests on trees by joining leaves with silk produced by the larvae. These ants are very active moving on the trees and on the ground in search of food. They are highly voracious feeding on a large range of insects visiting the trees, and are important in controlling many insect pests in fruit trees and coconut palms. In spite of these benefits, weaver ants are considered by some as a pest due to their aggressiveness combined with painful bites, which makes fruit picking difficult, and to their association with honeydew-producing insects. <br><br>They can foster the build-up of honeydew producing, but it has been observed that they do kill some of them when the amount of honeydew produced by these insects is bigger than the amount required by the colony of weaver ants.

The ants fall down of the branches and have difficulties to return giving time to farmers to harvest. Other farmers rub their hands and arms with wood ashes, to prevent the ants from attacking them. Other rub their arms and feet with certain repellant products before climbing the tree, use protective clothing or harvest at times of the day when weaver ants are least active (Van Mele and Cuc, 2007). </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <hr><h3><strong><a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects.

Varela</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Parasitic wasps</strong> </h3> <p><strong>Description: </strong>There is a wide range of parasitic wasps with a wide variation also in size (1-6 mm long). Parasitic wasps attack eggs, larvae, pupae and sometimes adults of many other groups of insects. They usually lay their eggs within or on the body of the host. Eggs hatch into tiny yellow-creamy larvae that feed on the body fluids or the body tissues of their host. The mature larvae of the parasitic wasp pupate in or outside the host body. The number of wasps that can develop within a single host varies with the parasitoid species and the host. In aphids, leafminers, mealybugs, usually one single parasitic wasp develops on a single host. In the case of caterpillars, a single wasp, a small number, or a large number of wasps (sometimes more that 100) may develop within each caterpillar, depending mainly on the species of parasitoid. Larvae of some wasps pupate in the host, while others emerge from the host when feeding is completed and pupate nearby. Adult parasitic wasps feed on pollen, nectar, honeydew and other sugary substances, but some are predacious feeding on the host contributing to mortality caused by their larvae. <br><br>There may be few or no symptoms of parasitoid presence within its insect host. In other cases such as aphids, mealybugs and some caterpillars the host insect may become swollen and/or permanently paralysed. When the larvae of the parasitic wasp pupate, the parasitised aphid or mealybug turns brown and hard and remains stuck to the leaf. In this stage they are known as mummies and can be easily recognised. </p> <p>The parasitic wasps emerge through a round hole in the aphids or mealybug abdomen a few days later. Parasitised whiteflies nymphs can be distinguished from healthy ones. Parasitised nymphs are dark while healthy nymphs are usually yellowish greenish. <br><br>Field collection and rearing of immature stages (eggs and larvae) of pests to check if any parasitoid emerges is often a useful method to determine whether parasitism has occurred. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Main prey:</strong> Parasitic wasps are important natural enemies of moth and butterfly eggs, bug eggs, caterpillars, leafminers, aphids, mealybugs, and whiteflies. They play an important role in natural control. In cases where the naturally occurring natural enemies do not provide satisfactory control, or in cases where an exotic pest has been introduced without its natural enemies, parasitic wasps have been introduced and released. Some examples of parasitic wasps introduced in the region for control of important pests are: <em>Diadegma semiclausum </em>and <em>Cotesia plutellae </em>for control of the Diamond back moth on crucifers, <em>Cotesia flavipes </em>for control of cereal stemborers, <em>Apoanygyrus diversicornis </em>for control of the cassava mealybug, <em>Gyranusoidea tebygi </em>and <em>Anagyrus mangicola </em>for control of the mango mealybug; <em>Diglyphus isaea </em>for control of leafminers, <em>Cales noacki </em>for control of the woolly whitefly on citrus and <em>Encarsia formosa </em>for control of whiteflies. </p> <p> </p> <table cellspacing="10" style="width: 100%; line-height: normal;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/1790.300x200.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td><strong>Parasitic wasp Oomyzus</strong> laying eggs in diamondback moth caterpillar</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) icipe</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p><br><strong>Commercial availability</strong>: Parasitic wasps commercially available in Kenya: <em>Aphidius transcapicus </em>(Aphitec(r)) for control of aphids, <em>Trichogrammatoidea</em>sp.

Female flies lay tiny whitish oval eggs on their host, and sometimes on leaves. Upon hatching the fly larvae (maggots) burrow through the body and feed on the prey. With species that lay eggs on leaves, eggs are ingested by caterpillars or larvae of beetles while feeding on foliage. Pupation occurs either within or outside the body of the host.

Bt works by interfering with digestion - therefore, to be effective it must be eaten by the insects. Insects are more sensitive to Bt in the larval stage. After larvae ingest Bt spores, the bacterium produces toxins that paralyse the digestive tract of the larvae causing it to cease eating. Death will follow from hunger or infection; the time of death can range from 12 hours to 5 days after ingestion, but since the insects stop feeding shortly after exposure, damage to the crop is reduced. <br><br><strong>Main prey:</strong> There are different strains or varieties of Bt that differ in toxicity to insects: The <em>Bt.</em> <em>kurstaki</em> and <em>B. aizawai </em>infect moths (caterpillars), <em>Bt. tenebrionis </em>and <em>B. San Diego</em> infect leaf beetles, and <em>Bt israelensis </em>(BTI) affects mosquitoes, black flies and fungus gnats. The different strains of Bt are specific, this means they do not harm beneficial or non-target insects. Commercial availability: Several microbial pesticides based on different strains of Bt are available in Kenya: Xentari WDG(r) and Florbac(r) (<em>Bt.</em> var. <em>aizawai</em>), Thuricide HP(r) wettable powder and Dipel 2X WP (<em>Bt</em> var. <em>kurstaki</em>). As the larvae must eat Bt treated foliage for these bio-insecticides to work, thorough coverage of the foliage is very important, and use of a sticker is advisable. Bt should be applied when the larvae are small.</p> <p><a href="../PlantHealth/Bio-pesticide-Bt-Bacillus-thuringiensis.html">For further information on Bt click here</a> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <hr><h3><strong><a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Occurring worldwide, most fungi are largely invisible to the naked eye, living for the most part in soil, dead matter, and as symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi.

Caterpillars or sawflies infected by nuclear polyhedrosis viruses become flaccid, die rapidly, and hang limply by the abdominal legs from leaves. At the slightest touch the insect body ruptures spilling the virus particles onto leaves infecting other insects. Other viruses act more slowly; infected caterpillars appear pale or have a chalky colour, become swollen and the development is retarded. Insects infected with viruses usually die prior to reaching adulthood and may turn black or brown after death due to secondary infection with bacteria.<br> </p> <p> </p> <hr><h3><strong>Nematodes:</strong> </h3> <p>Nematodes are long, thin round worms, so tiny that they usually can only be seen under the microscope. Insect-infecting nematodes are found in the soil, and infect many different types of insects living or foraging in the soil or on the ground such as the larvae of some moths, butterflies, beetles and flies, as well as adult crickets and grasshoppers. <br>The most commonly studied nematodes belong to the groups Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae, and have been used in the biological control of insect pests. These nematodes are associated with bacteria, which are released from the nematode into the body cavity of the insect, where they multiply, killing the insect within 48 hours. The nematodes then feed on the insect liquefying tissues, develop and reproduce for several generations inside the cadaver. When the food supplies run out, juvenile nematodes move into the soil to find new hosts. The bodies of insects killed by nematodes are yellow, orange or bright red in colour.<br><br>In some cases, farmers can produce homemade microbial pesticides by collecting diseased larvae and crushing and mixing them with water in a blender. They then filter out the large tissue masses to leave the liquid for spraying the crop. The pathogen will infect and kill other pests in the crop. </p> <p> </p> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-body-phmulfi field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-6">Information Source Links</h2> <ul><li>Aglearn.net, the Network for Sustainable Agriculture, Thailand.
