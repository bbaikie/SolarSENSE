Infections with no illness can also occur in wild buffalo, waterbuck, hartebeest, wildebeest, deer and possibly goats.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Mode of Spread </h3> <p>This disease is only transmitted through mosquito bites, not through direct contact between sick and healthy animals. The virus does not persist in recovered cattle and most recovered cattle have life-long immunity. The insects responsible for spread of the virus are several species of midges (small flies, smaller than mosquitoes) and mosquitoes. Outbreaks are more common when wet conditions favour multiplication of the midge and mosquito populations. Wind may spread the midges and mosquitoes over large areas.<br><br>Occurrence and severity of the disease may vary from year to year.

Therefore, it is important to try to prevent pesticide resistance. ">resistance</a> of the cattle population is diminished, because the old immune cattle are all gone. During the periods in between large outbreaks, the disease is still present but the number of animals affected is very low and sporadic cases may occur without being recognised.<br><br>Recurrence depends primarily on suitable environmental conditions for the increase and dissemination of the insect vector.

Sometimes a swollen, blue tongue is evident. The face swells. Deep ulcers, filled with white, dead debris appear at any site where there is irritation.</li> <li>Towards the end of the fever, lameness and stiffness develop. The lameness is due to inflammation at the coronary band of the hoof (where the hoof meets the skin of the leg), manifesting as a red or purplish band which travels down the hoof with the growth of horn. The stiffness is due to muscle pain.

It also affects humans as Sleeping Sickness. The disease occurs worldwide in tropical and sub tropical countries. It is caused by microscopically small blood parasites called Trypanasoma or, in short, Tryps. The major species are <em>Trypanasoma congolense, Trypanasoma vivax, Trypanasoma brucei </em>and <em>Trypanasoma simiae</em>.<br><br>In Kenya trypanosomiasis occurs where host, parasite and transmitting Tse-Tse flies occur together. This includes areas near Lake Victoria, Southern Kenya around Lake Magadi and the Nguruman Escarpment and the Mara, the Coastal areas and around Tsavo National Park. Transmission of <em>T.vivax </em>in cattle can sometimes be maintained in the absence of Tse-Tse flies through normal biting flies (Tabanids). This happens in areas bordering Tse-Tse infested zones where migrating infected cattle have introduced the Trypanosomes. - The cool Highlands and arid parts of North Kenya are free from Tse-Tse transmitted Tryps, except when infected animals are brought in from <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Prevalent in or peculiar to a particular locality, region, or people: diseases endemic to the tropics. ">endemic</a> areas.</p> <p>In humans the disease is known as sleeping sickness.<br><br><br><br><strong>Mode of Spread</strong></p> <p>The disease is transmitted in Africa by Glossina tsetse flies and in <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Permission granted to an operator by a certification body to be excluded from the need to comply with normal requirements of the standards. Exceptions are granted on the basis of clear criteria, with clear justification and for a limited time period only. ">exception</a>al cases also mechanically by biting flies. Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes are maintained in wild animals. Adult Tse-Tse flies are aggressive blood-suckers and seek out suitable hosts in daylight by sight and smell. Different fly species favour certain hosts. Warthog, eland, buffalo bushbuck, bushpig, duiker, certain reptiles and hippo are peculiarly sought out by certain flies. In these wild animals the disease is mild and symptomless and they act as <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="is a place where a great stock of anything is accumulated ">reservoir</a> hosts from which domesticated livestock can be infected.</p> <p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/3586.300x200.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Adult Glossina Tsetse fly</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) John W. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="McGarry">McGarry</span> and the School of Vet Science in Liverpool</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p>Animals are infected with trypansomes by the bite of an infected tsetse fly. Tsetse flies themselves become infected when they feed on an infected animal host: the ingested trypanosomes undergo a cycle of development in the fly lasting between 8 to 35 days before infective trypanosomes are produced. Once infected a fly is usually capable of transmitting trypanosomes for the rest of its life. Infection rates in wild populations of tsetse flies are normally low, varying from 1 to 20%.<br><br><strong>All species of domestic animals are susceptible to infection</strong> but infections with tsetse fly transmitted Tryps are particularly important in cattle. African Zebus are fully susceptible to Tryps infection, but certain breeds of <strong>small hump-less West African dwarf-cattle </strong>i.e. the Ndama can be resistant.</p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Types of Tsetse Flies</strong> </h3> <p>Tsetse flies can be divided into three groups - <strong>forest</strong>, <strong><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="riverine">riverine</span> </strong>and <strong>savannah</strong>. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Trypanosomiasis">Trypanosomiasis</span> becomes important when man and domestic livestock compete with wildlife and tsetse for graying land, or come into contact with tsetse as a result of other activities (e.g. cattle crossing into tste-tse infested riverine zones during drought).<br><br><strong>Forest tsetse</strong> are of least importance as their <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="The area over which an animal species naturally exists; the area where a species occurs.

The most important are the <strong>savannah tsetse</strong> as the inhabit vast areas of land otherwise suitable for grazing animals. The flies prefer shade and have a limited flight distance. They tend to live along dry riverbeds, areas of thick bush and clumps of trees. From here they venture out during the day to feed on wild and domestic animals.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <table align="left" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 40%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/3587.300x200.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Tabanid fly</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) John W. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="McGarry">McGarry</span> and the School of Vet Science in Liverpool </p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Biting flies</strong> are involved mainly in the transmission of <em>T. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="evansi">evansi</span></em> in camels which is transmitted by <strong><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="tabanid">tabanid</span> camel flies</strong>. <br><br><strong><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Tabanid">Tabanid</span> flies </strong>are persistent, aggressive feeders, annoying the host so that feeding is often interrupted, thus ensuring that several new hosts may be bitten, increasing the possibility of multiple infections.

Vets can check for trypanosomes by directly examining a fresh blood sample under the microscope. Tryps can also be seen in dried and stained blood smears, but chances of finding the tryps are lower than in fresh blood. If fresh liquid blood samples have overstayed, it can be difficult to see the Tryps under the microscope.<br><br>The use of small field centrifuges has helped greatly in Tryps diagnosis in the field. Other diseases can be confused superficially with trypanosomiasis, so demonstration of the parasite is most important. Hence the alerting of a skilled veterinarian is vital to obtain a diagnosis. ECF in <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period. ">acute</a> cases, and worm infestations and malnutrition in chronic cases can be confused with trypanosmiasis.<br><br> </p> <p> </p> <h3><strong>Prevention and Control</strong> <br> </h3> <p> </p> <p>Avoid fly-infested areas and minimize contact between livestock and wild animals.</p> <ul><li>The use of insecticidal attractants in tsetse traps has considerably reduced tsetse fly numbers in the areas which they have been used, utilising the fact that tsetse flies are attracted to colours such as dark blue. These traps should be used wherever possible. Trapping technology is relatively simple and less polluting to the environment than insecticide application.</li> <li>Take animals to water when fly activity is low, flies are inactive at night - so crossing a river or watering in the dark is an option.</li> <li>Repel flies with smoke from smouldering cow dung.</li> <li>Seperate sick animals from healthy ones. The disease is not contagious but when cattle are together they attract flies, which may transmit infection.</li> <li>Use of less tryps sensitive breeds of cattle such as Orma Boran.</li> <li>Clear thick bush to reduce tsetse <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="The area over which an animal species naturally exists; the area where a species occurs.

">habitat</a>.</li> <li>Use insecticidal pour-ons on cattle such as Cypertick and Ectomin (not organic and mostly useless).</li> <li>Frequent spraying and dipping of animals.</li> <li>Use preventative anti-Tryps drugs (called trypanocide or trypanocidals) such as Samorin and Suramin - one injection prevents Tryps infection for many weeks.</li> <li>Good nutrition, especially where exotic breeds are reared.</li> </ul><h3><br><br><strong>Tsetse Trap</strong> </h3> <p><br>Insect specialists at <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="ICIPE">ICIPE</span> found out that tsetse flies are attracted to blue <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="colour">colour</span>, prefer black cloth to land on and will use white <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="colour">colour</span> as an orientation. According to this research findings, traps have been designed with blue/black/white cloth. To discourage theft, slits can be made in the blue cloth. To <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="incease">incease</span> trap efficiency, cow urine is placed under the traps in plastic bottles. <br><br>Trap densities: In the case of savannah species each fly may disperse up to 500 <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="metres">metres</span> in a single day, so that with an average trap density of just four traps per km2, there is a high likelihood that each fly encounters at least one trap. However, species living in forests disperse little more than <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="5-10m">5-10m</span> per day, so that effective trap densities need to be very much higher. <br><br>Traps are relatively inexpensive and lend themselves to community participation. However, problems are experienced due to trap theft, vandalism, and damage by wildlife. To reduce theft of traps, and vandalism requires at the very least a high degree of community education and awareness-raising. Such community awareness can be extended further to community participation, involvement of local people in control activities, and even community-based systems, such as management and financing. <br><br>More information on different models of tsetse traps available under <a href="http://www.vestergaard.com/zerofly-screen" target="_new">www.vestergaard-frandsen.com</a>. </p> <h3><br><br><strong>Recommended Treatment</strong> </h3> <p>No new drugs for either treatment or prevention have been developed for a very long time so it is vital to use those few that are available properly to avoid drug <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Ability of a living organism not to get affected by a disease or pest; or of a pest not to be affected by a pesticide.
