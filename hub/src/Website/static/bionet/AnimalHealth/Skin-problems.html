Most are host specific, while some are shared between different species of animals. The mites feed on the surface or burrow just beneath the skin, making tiny tunnels. They cause intense irritation and itching.<br><br><strong>Mode of infection / spread</strong> <br>The mites are spread through close direct contact between infected and clean animals (e.g. inside the stable, in a paddock, in a <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Boma">Boma</span>). Especially in cool and wet conditions, the mites can survive for some time in dead skin scabs shed by affected animals. Objects contaminated by such scabs can also spread the mites, e.g. fence posts and tree stems on which animals like to rub, brushes or saddles used for several animals.<br><br><strong>Signs and Lesions</strong> <br>Infested animals rub and scratch continuously (other skin diseases do not cause permanent itching!) and develop patches of inflamed skin where the hair is falling out and which later are covered by dry crusts. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Sarcoptes">Sarcoptes</span> mites are usually found on the neck, on the legs and the loin area next to the tail.

The virus then spreads rapidly to other lambs in the flock, both directly and indirectly. The incidence within a flock may be as high as 90%. The few deaths which occur are the result of extension of wounds within the <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="The respiratory tract is the passages through which air enters and leaves the body ">respiratory tract</a>, but the mortality rate may reach 15% if the lambs are badly cared for or if secondary infection or fly strike occurs.</div> <div> </div> <div>Epidemics tend to occur twice yearly - the first peak is associated with the disease in sucking lambs, the later one with susceptible stock lambs.

The underlying tissue is frequently also involved. Wounds occur in all animals on every farm and arise from a variety of causes. </div> <div>Wounds may be classified in various ways. For example they may be described according to their site - wounds of the neck, head, chest, abdomen or limbs. Another classification may indicate their particular type - for example<strong> crushing, lacerating or penetrating</strong> wounds, <strong>bites by other animals</strong>, snakes or insects etc, <strong>cuts or burns</strong>. Wounds may be <strong>fresh, bleeding, infected, gangrenous or swollen</strong>. Some wounds may be small and insignificant. Others may be large and even life threatening, especially if they involve major blood vessels. Such descriptions are very important when describing the nature of a wound to a veterinarian who then should be in a position to offer useful advice even if he, or she, is unable to attend personally to the case.</div> <p><br> </p> <p><br><strong>What to do about Wounds</strong></p> <div>It is best to assume that all wounds are potentially infected and to treat them as such, irrespective of their cause, site or nature.</div> <div>Large, deep wounds requiring suturing are best dealt with by a veterinarian but the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="layperson">layperson</span> can do much either to make things easier until the arrival of a qualified person or to treat smaller wounds without outside assistance.</div> <p> </p> <p><br><strong>Prevention of infection </strong></p> <div>Prevention of Infection is important. <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Pollution of organic product or land; or contact with any material that would render the product unsuitable for organic certification. ">Contamination</a> of wounds may lead to severe generalized disease such as gas gangrene, tetanus etc as the bacteria which cause such diseases live in the soil or even in the buildings where animals are housed. </div> <div>The most important principle in the care of fresh wounds is to maintain the viability and the defensive mechanisms of the tissues, so that they may play a part, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="unweakened">unweakened</span>, in the healing process. <br>All harmful influences must be avoided during and after treatment.</div> <div>All instruments and utensils and dressing must be scrupulously clean before use.

Unless the bleeding is very severe as from a large severed blood vessel then firm pressure with a pad of dry cloth, towel or large wad of cotton wool over a period of several minutes should in time stop the bleeding. </div> <div>If this pressure is not sufficient and the bleeding continues and begins to weaken the animal then a tourniquet may be applied. This is a firm band applied and tied a few inches away from the wound on the side nearest to the heart. This may be made from anything that is strong and long enough - a bandage, a handkerchief, a rope, a piece of inner tubing etc. With any tourniquet the pressure should be maintained for a few minutes after the bleeding has stopped but it should never ever be tied for longer than necessary and never longer than 15 minutes or so.</div> <div>Once the bleeding has stopped wait for a few more minutes. Then carefully shave the edges of the wound for about 2-3 inches all round. Then clean the edges with antiseptic or spirit. If there is foreign material in the wound such as dirt, grass, glass, grit, dung, this should be carefully removed and the wound washed out with salty or clean water. Instill antibiotic ointment in the form of a tube of <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="intramammary">intramammary</span> ointment into the wound or sprinkle it with antibiotic powder.</div> <p><br><strong>Large gaping wounds</strong></p> <div>If the wound is a gaping one then it will be necessary to join the edges together with stitches to accelerate healing. This may be done with nylon sutures, or with thick sewing-cotton or thin tape if nylon is unavailable. </div> <div>All material to be used should be boiled before use and the operator&#39;s hands must be scrubbed clean and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="To reduce, by physical or chemical means, the number of potentially harmful microorganisms in the environment, to a level that does not compromise food safety and suitability.

The stitches should be single and separate and loosely tied. Antibiotic should be given after the wound has been treated. If healing does not proceed cleanly and pus appears then remove the lower stitches to allow drainage and keep the wound clean and open until healing occurs. All wounds must be protected against flies which may lay their eggs in wounds which may then become infested with maggots.</div> <div>Wounds on the lower limbs should be carefully bandaged with a firm pressure bandage after treatment and the bandages changed every 2 or 3 days to check on the progress of healing. Do not attempt to stitch wounds on the lower limbs. The stitches invariably will not hold and will tear our.</div> <p> </p> <p><strong>Puncture wounds:</strong></p> <div>Should not be stitched, but left open to drain and cleaned and treated frequently with antibiotic either locally or by injection. All discharges of pus or serum should be washed away whenever they appear. </div> <p><br><strong>Closed wounds:</strong></p> <div>May result in contusions or bruises when the skin is unbroken, but there may be much damage to underlying tissues in the form of swelling, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="haemorrhage">haemorrhage</span> (internal bleeding) and tearing of muscles, tendons and ligaments. There may be considerable pain, and the area may be swollen, tense, hot and be <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="discoloured">discoloured</span> black, red or purple. </div> <div>Most bruises resolve without any special treatment but may benefit from anti-inflammatory drugs of the application of cold water, ice or in some cases by the application of a kaolin and <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="glycerine">glycerine</span> poultice. </div> <div> </div> <div>Some closed wounds may develop into <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Haematomas">Haematomas</span>. These are large blood blisters which develop when there is bleeding into a pocket underneath the skin. They are not usually painful but may be quite large. If left alone they will gradually shrink as the blood inside clots and organizes and the serum is absorbed. Finally a scar will be left. To confirm that the swelling is a <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="haematoma">haematoma</span> a large sterile needle should be pushed through the skin into the swelling when serum or blood will come out. A <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="haematoma">haematoma</span> should not be opened immediately in case there is still seepage of blood. After a few days it can be opened. The lower part should be carefully shaved and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="To reduce, by physical or chemical means, the number of potentially harmful microorganisms in the environment, to a level that does not compromise food safety and suitability. ">disinfect</a>ed and a line of local <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="anaethetic">anaethetic</span> injected. Then an incision should be made through the skin. Once serum starts to flow from the wound the cut can be enlarged to allow all the fluid to flow out. An injection of antibiotic should be given to prevent infection from developing.</div> <p> </p> <p><strong>Abscesses</strong></p> <div>An abscess is a swelling with pus usually below the skin. It must be differentiated from other swellings such as those caused by hernias, ruptures, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="tumours">tumours</span>, cysts and <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="haematomas">haematomas</span>. <br>Abscesses are usually hot and painful when touched, whereas ruptures, hernias, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="tumours">tumours</span>, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="haematomas">haematomas</span> and cysts are normally non-painful. Hernias and ruptures usually occur below the belly and may contain internal organs such as a loop of intestine. Cutting a swelling like this could be disastrous. So check and think before taking action, by feeling the swelling carefully. A hernia or rupture is usually soft and can be pushed back into the body and is usually situated on the body wall. </div> <div> </div> <div>An animal with an abscess may have a raised body temperature due the pus inside the abscess. Squeezing the swelling may cause pus to ooze through the skin. <br>In order to confirm that the swelling is an abscess a sterile needle should be carefully pushed through the skin into the swelling after first shaving the overlying skin and applying spirit or antiseptic to the site of the insertion. If the swelling is an abscess then pus will appear in the hub of the needle. If a cyst there may be clear fluid, if a <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="haematoma">haematoma</span> serum, if a <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="tumour">tumour</span> then possibly nothing may appear. </div> <p> </p> <p><br><br><strong>Treatment of <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="abcesses">abcesses</span> </strong></p> <div>1.

Lancing the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="abcess">abcess</span> when it is ready.</div> <p> </p><div>Mix salt or Epsom salts in water as hot as you can comfortably bear your hands in. Add a teaspoonful of salt in half a <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="litre">litre</span> of water. Soak a piece of clean cloth or cotton wool with this solution and hold it on the swelling. When the cloth gets cool soak it again in the hot solution. Continue for about 5 minutes and do this at least 4 times daily.</div> <div>The skin may soften and break, discharging pus, which may smell foul. Keep on bathing with the solution to encourage the drainage to continue so that no pus remains when the skin closes and heals. </div> <div>If the abscess does not burst after a few days, then it may be necessary to lance it. </div> <div> </div> <div>This is done using a scalpel or a very sharp, very clean blade as follows:</div> <div>Shave the hair over the swelling and clean the area with soap and water, followed by spirit or alcohol. If you have any, inject local <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="anaesthetic">anaesthetic</span> along the line of the proposed incision. Cut boldly through the skin at the lowest point to facilitate drainage. Sometimes you may have to cut quite deeply but if you saw pus draining through the needle this deep cut is necessary. Make one long vertical cut. Place a clean finger (if possible use <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="To reduce, by physical or chemical means, the number of potentially harmful microorganisms in the environment, to a level that does not compromise food safety and suitability. ">disinfect</a>ed plastic gloves) through the hole to help to release the pus which should pour out, often under pressure.</div> <div>When the pus has stopped flowing, flush the cavity with a dilute solution of iodine or hydrogen peroxide solution.</div> <div>Continue bathing the area with a warm salt solution for the next few days. Give an injection of antibiotic, such as long acting <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="oxytetracycline">oxytetracycline</span>.
