Ticks not only sucks blood thereby generally weakening their hosts if they are many enough - they also act as major disease carriers between various species of animals. There are over 13 different tick families and more than 650 different kinds of ticks in Africa. All of them suck blood and when occurring in numbers can actually kill especially young livestock by sucking alone.</div> <div> <p>In this section we only mention the most economically important species of ticks - the ones that have been identified as major carriers of the diseases mentioned under tick borne diseases.</p> <p>The diseases caused by ticks are highly devastating and lead to the use of very poisonous acaricides, to which ticks develop <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Ability of a living organism not to get affected by a disease or pest; or of a pest not to be affected by a pesticide.

Nevertheless, in some situations and under certain circumstances it can be relevant to use acaricides. Even under organic farming conditions, we sometimes have to acknowledge the fact that we are confronted with highly deadly diseases that can take away the fundament for the livestock production on a farm or in an area. At the same time, it is also very important to be aware of following:</p> <ol><li>The blanket use of acaricide can in fact worsen the situation because it creates susceptible animals, apart from the fact</li> <li>That there are residues in the products from this animal, and</li> <li>That the development of <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Ability of a living organism not to get affected by a disease or pest; or of a pest not to be affected by a pesticide.

In this way, organic agriculture lead the way to search for efficient and more natural ways of managing ticks and the diseases they cause. </li> </ol><p> </p> <h3><strong>Understanding the epidemiology of ticks and tick borne diseases</strong></h3> <p>Ticks carry deadly diseases, and they are therefore called &#39;vectors&#39; for these diseases. Control of ticks and tick borne diseases requires a thorough understanding of their epidemiology and tick-host relationship. This understanding can help making a strategy to avoid these diseases. There are big differences between the different types of ticks and tick borne diseases, e.g. in how they are geographically spread, whether they are dose-dependent or not, and whether they only affect one animal species or more. Even though there are these differences, there are important similarities between the different parasites and the host-parasite relations, which are important to notice and which can help in finding ways of managing them, as will become apparent under the description of ticks: </p> <ol><li>Hosts (=affected animals) can acquire immunity to the ticks as well as the diseases</li> <li>The hosts can survive without becoming ill even if it is attacked by tick that carry the diseases, because they are resistant to the diseases</li> <li>Hosts can act as carriers also if they are not sick themselves, but because they are resistant to a certain level of the diseases. This is called &#39;endemic stability&#39; and is described below.</li> </ol><p> </p> </div> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Families of Ticks:</strong></h3> <div>The main families of ticks that affect livestock in East Africa are:<br>1. <strong>Soft Ticks</strong> (<span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Argas">Argas</span> and <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Ornithodoros">Ornithodoros</span> families<br>2. <strong>Hard Ticks</strong> (<span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Rhipicephalus">Rhipicephalus</span>, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Amblyomma">Amblyomma</span>, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Hyalomma">Hyalomma</span>, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Boophilus">Boophilus</span> etc)</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-2"><strong>Soft ticks and their control</strong></h2> <div> <p>The soft ticks are a big problem for poultry and other small stock, but as far as literature has indicated do not seem to take a big part in transfer of diseases generally in livestock.</p> <p>Soft ticks are usually fairly small (rarely above 5mm long). Their mouth parts are not easily seen as they sit on the underside of the tick, and their backs do not have the &quot;Scutum&quot; or hard back shield that the hard ticks have. </p> <p>As mentioned soft ticks are mainly a problem in poultry and small stock, but they will feed on all the animals within their range. So also dogs and other domestic animals can help them spread.</p> <p>The main damage of soft ticks is that they suck the blood of livestock - and when they are many the amount of blood sucked will cause animals to become anaemic, get tired and unproductive. For poultry and other small stock this can be a very serious problem, greatly affecting health and productivity of the animals.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Control measures</strong></p> <ul><li>As always - prevention is better than cure. Farmers have found that spreading ashes or diatomite in nesting sites and areas where the birds dust bathe, the soft tick problem can be somehow controlled or at least greatly reduced in number and thereby not affecting productivity to a noticeable degree.</li> <li>Also dry leaves of Lantana, eucalyptus, neem, pyrethrum and tephrosia added to the ashes and or diatomite in nests and dustbath areas will further reduce numbers of soft ticks.</li> <li>If the problems persist, please ask your vet about the best and least poisonous chemical dusting powder recommended for this problem.</li> </ul><p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" height="352" src="../res/res/files/4029.700x600.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none; width: 269px; height: 204px;" width="451"><img alt="" height="380" src="../res/res/files/4030.700x600.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none; width: 266px; height: 263px;" width="407"></td> </tr><tr><td> <p><strong>Soft ticks</strong> (Genus Argas), picture from &quot;Taxonomy of African Ticks&quot;</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="ICIPE">ICIPE</span> Science Press</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> </div> <div> </div> <div> <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" height="598" src="../res/res/files/4027.700x600.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none; width: 246px; height: 279px;" width="489"><img alt="" height="414" src="../res/res/files/4028.700x600.png" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none; width: 234px; height: 265px;" width="313"></td> </tr><tr><td> <p><strong>Soft ticks </strong>(Genus Ornithodoros), picture from &quot;Taxonomy of African Ticks&quot;</p> </td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="ICIPE">ICIPE</span> Science Press</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p> </p> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-3"><strong>Hard ticks</strong> and their control</h2> </div> <p>The main disease carriers are the following:</p> <ol><li>The <strong>Blue tick, or cattle tick </strong>(<span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Boophilus">Boophilus</span> sp) This major family have many species each of which have different geographical distribution.

Alternating between sheep and cattle does the same. It can be combined with treatment of cattle just before they enter a new paddock. Certain birds (oxpeckers, cattle egrets, chickens) also contribute to an overall reduction in tick numbers on livestock and on pastures, so that means that environments which favor those birds should be encouraged. Organically farmed land with no pesticide use and a good biodiversity has a good chance of doing that.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Hand picking of ticks</h3> <p>As explained above, hand picking of ticks can contribute to building up an <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Prevalent in or peculiar to a particular locality, region, or people: diseases endemic to the tropics.

On the other hand, picking leaves and preparing a solution for spraying also requires labor. One should be aware that plants can also be very poisonous, and nicotine / tabacco leaves, which were previously seen as one option for treating ticks and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="A parasite that lives on the outside of its host.

The disease occurs worldwide but has serious implications in the tropics because of the high prevalence of the host ticks. Other names of this disease are Red water and Cattle tick fever.</div> <h3><br><br><strong>Mode of spread</strong></h3> <div>Babesiosis parasites are spread only through their carrier tick. Ticks acquire <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="babesia">babesia</span> infections from infected animals.</div> <div>In Africa, the Cattle tick which transmits<em> B. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="bovis">bovis</span></em> was introduced at the end of the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="19th">19th</span> century. <em>B.bovis</em> thus only occurs in those areas of Africa to which Cattle tick has spread. In Kenya the Blue tick, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Boophilusdecoloratus"><em>Boophilus</em>decoloratus</span>, which is the main transmitter, can only transmit <em>B. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Bigemina">Bigemina</span></em> and as a result this species assumes more importance than <em>B. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="bovis">bovis</span></em>. </div> <div><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Tranmission">Tranmission</span> occurs <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="transovarially">transovarially</span>, that is, from the maternal body to eggs within the ovaries.

The antibiotic used is a long acting (LA) <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Oxytetracycline">Oxytetracycline</span>, which inhibits development of the parasite when given at the onset of infection. The animal is injected with live vaccines of East Coast Fever. This will confer protection to this strain for more than 3 years. However there are different strains of East Coast Fever and when <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="immunised">immunised</span> cattle are moved to a different area they may not be protected. Likewise if infected cattle from another area move in to a property they may bring in with them other strains of East Coast Fever. </li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Effective Tick control</strong>. Tick control continues to be the most important measure in the fight to prevent cattle from becoming infected with East Coast Fever. The Brown Ear Tick is a three host tick i.e. it does not spend its entire life on the animal but drops off between the various stages of its life cycle; therefore when an outbreak occurs, either on the property or in the immediate area, once weekly dipping or spraying will not be sufficient. Dipping or spraying must be done twice weekly to break the transmission cycle between cattle and tick and continued as long as is necessary, for example if the tick problem continues to be unacceptably high. Pyrethrum grease should be applied to the inside of the ears and below the base of the tail, whose end should be clipped. All of this is costly, but not as costly as losing valuable stock or having to use very expensive curative drugs. </li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Newer tick control measures include the Spot-on</strong> / Pour-on drugs </li> </ul><p><br><strong>Treatment</strong></p> <div>Treatment of East Coast Fever / Corridor Disease is effective but it MUST be started EARLY in the disease process by a qualified veterinarian.

The cause is a toxin attracted to skin, which is secreted by females of certain strains of the tick <em><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Hyalomma">Hyalomma</span> <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="truncatum">truncatum</span></em>. Thus, it is not an infection. It is mainly a disease of young calves, although adults are also susceptible. It occurs in Eastern, Central and Southern Africa, and in Sri Lanka and India.</div> <p><br><strong>Mode of spread</strong><br>The toxin develops in the tick, not in the calf. The potential to produce toxin is retained by ticks for up to 20 generations. The disease cannot be transmitted from an infected animal to a susceptible animal by contact or by inoculation of blood. </p> <div>The severity of the disease depends on the length of time toxin-producing ticks spend on a susceptible animal. A very short period of time has no effect - the animal remains susceptible. A period just long enough to produce a reaction may confer immunity. But, if the exposure is longer than 5 days, severe clinical signs and death may result.</div> <div> </div> <div>Recovery confers immunity which lasts for up to, and perhaps longer than 4 years.</div> <h3> </h3> <h3><strong>Signs of Sweating Sickness</strong></h3> <div style="clear: both;"> </div> <p><strong>Clinical Signs</strong> </p><div>The severity of the disease ranges from the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="peracute"><a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="very acute; a duration of a few hours only.
