">predator</a>s want rabbit meat.</p> <p>Rabbits are alert, awake or sleeping, and have very good senses, in particular hearing and smelling, but they can see both 360<sup>o </sup>around them and in the air, but their eyes are very poor in bright sunlight. Therefore, they forage in early mornings and in twilight. If living in safer conditions they graze several hours every day. They can often sense vibrations in the ground from other animals running or walking. They have a peculiar flight behavior running in straight line and then abruptly changing direction, to shake off the pursuer. When they sense danger, they stomp their muscular hind legs in the ground to warn their fellow rabbits.</p> <p>They give birth to 4-12 kittens, which are well hidden in a nest the first 8-10 days of their lives, blind and naked at birth, and only need feed morning and evening. They can have several litters during a one-year period. Rabbits are pure herbivores and born to live on the ground; they forage and hide on the ground, and do not like to be lifted, but they like to climb up on small hills or somewhere where they can get a better overview. They are curious animals, even though they have to be alert and are easily scared. Most rabbit breeds live underground in holes and others in nests on the ground.</p> <p>They are social animals, living in colonies or groups. They have been introduced to some environments where they did not live naturally, and have caused major problems because they did not have <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects.

This is because of their minimal investment requirements and ability to reproduce fast. Their feed requirement is low, especially with regard to demand for grain. Their housing and disease control management requirements are also low. Yet their meat is highly nutritious and healthier source of protein when compared with other sources of meat. Second to ostrich, rabbit meat is the highest protein meat available. It is fat and cholesterol free, so is not only highly nutritious but also very easily digested. It is, therefore, much better value than chicken. The potential for rabbit production is high, considering that other sources of meat are often scarce and out of the financial reach of most families.</p> <p>Rabbit production has experienced a steady growth in the past few years, with gender biases associated with its production fading away. This is a significant change considering that for many years, rabbit production in Kenya was confined to the youth, mainly 4-K club members and young farmers. Though rabbit meat marketing is yet to gain ground, there is hope that with the growing awareness of the benefits of rabbit meat, it will be possible for rabbit meat to be introduced into the regular meat market.</p> <p>The realization that rabbits are well suited to rapid production of protein has increased the number of industrialized production units just like in poultry. The most popular breeds used in the meat industry are the New Zealand White, Californian, Flemish Giant, French Ear lop, Chinchilla and Dutch. Other breeds include the Angora primarily kept for fur and as pets; most of the locally available breeds are cross breeds.</p> <p class="rtejustify">Exotic breeding stock is not readily available, although for the small farmer, there is nothing wrong with local stock because they can stand the local conditions usually more easy than exotic breeds. Marketing is still a big hurdle for the small farmer and, before venturing into the business, prospective farmers should research the market before they start. As the market grows, better stock will inevitably become available and more efforts can be made to improve management (including feeding). There is a shortage of facilities that will accept pelts for tanning in East Africa which is a shame, as the rabbit pelts are a much sought after commodity in the fashion and fabric industries around the world.</p> </div> </div> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-2">Breeds and Breeding</h2> <p>It is interesting to note that East Africa does not have wild rabbits. The brown creatures that are seen, mostly at night, on the plains are hares, not rabbits. The rabbits used for meat production are pure breeds of crosses of:</p> <ul><li>New Zealand White: has a good growth characteristic, capable of attaining slaughter weight of 3 kg live weight within 12-14 weeks depending on feeding regime. It is one of the best commercial breeds that grows to a weight of about 5 kg and has all-white <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="colour">colour</span> making its fur marketable. It is considered a dam breed because of its excellent mothering instinct.</li> <li>Californian White: it is bred to have broad shoulders and meaty back and hips and hence has a good meat breed with good dressing percentage. It is shorter and stockier and is white except for its ears, nose, feet and tail which are either dark grey or black. It is an ideal sire breed for interbreeding with other rabbit breeds for purposes of meat production.</li> <li>Flemish giant: this is one of the largest rabbit breeds, weighing up to 7 kg live weight. Though Kenyan farmers like it because of its size, this breed is not an ideal meat breed because of its high bone to meat ratio and its slow growth. Interbreeding it with other breeds may help improve its characteristics</li> <li>French Ear-lopped (sometimes referred to as Belgian Flop): The Lop family shares the distinction of being one of the oldest fancy breeds. The ear length, shape and size of the rabbit are a major attraction with farmers. It is <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="favoured">favoured</span> for meat production because of its body weight.</li> <li>Dutch: fairly small but compact rabbit with shorter forelegs. It often has characteristic markings.</li> <li>Kenya White and crosses from them</li> <li>Chinchilla: The Chinchilla is kept almost exclusively as a pet or for fur, which we do not support.</li> </ul><p> </p> <table align="left" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 50%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/2486.300x200.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Lop eared rabbit buck</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Valerie <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Corr">Corr</span>, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Naivasha">Naivasha</span>, Kenya</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 50%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/2487.300x200.jpg" style="border: 0px none white;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Large Kenya white crossed with Lop - note good size</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Valerie <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Corr">Corr</span>, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Naivasha">Naivasha</span>, Kenya</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p><br> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 854px; height: 262px;"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 423px;"><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/2488.300x200.jpg" style="border: 0px none white;"></td> <td style="width: 422px;"><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div class="file file-image file-image-jpeg" id="file-62079--2"> <div class="content"> <img alt="Flemish giant " class="media-element file-default img-responsive" data-delta="1" height="174" src="../sites/default/files/styles/large/public/animal_health/livestock_species/flemish_nafis5edf.jpg?itok=Ka5yKpdT" style="width: 270px; height: 156px;" title="Flemish giant " width="300"><div class="field field-name-field-captionimgas field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>Flemish giant </p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-img-copyright field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>(c) Nafis</p> </div></div></div> </div> </div> </div></td> </tr><tr><td style="width: 423px;">Kenyan x lop</td> <td style="width: 422px;"> </td> </tr><tr><td style="width: 423px;"> <p>(c) Valerie <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Corr">Corr</span>, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Naivasha">Naivasha</span>, Kenya</p> <p> </p> </td> <td style="width: 422px;"> </td> </tr></tbody></table><div style="clear: both;"> <p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 852px; height: 258px;"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 429px;"> <p></p><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div class="file file-image file-image-jpeg" id="file-62080--2"> <div class="content"> <img alt="Dutch" class="media-element file-default img-responsive" data-delta="2" height="244" src="../sites/default/files/styles/large/public/animal_health/livestock_species/dutch_nafis7c3a.jpg?itok=5vtY7RDm" style="width: 222px; height: 181px;" title="dutch" width="300"><div class="field field-name-field-captionimgas field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>Dutch</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-img-copyright field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>(c) Nafis</p> </div></div></div> </div> </div> </div> <p> </p> </td> <td style="width: 413px;"><div class="media media-element-container media-default"><div class="file file-image file-image-jpeg" id="file-62081--2"> <div class="content"> <img alt="Chinchilla" class="media-element file-default img-responsive" data-delta="3" height="226" src="../sites/default/files/styles/large/public/animal_health/livestock_species/chinchilla_nafisfd17.jpg?itok=SrejmiAU" style="width: 248px; height: 187px;" title="Chinchilla" width="300"><div class="field field-name-field-captionimgas field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>Chinchilla</p> </div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-img-copyright field-type-text field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <p>(c) Nafis</p> </div></div></div> </div> </div> </div></td> </tr></tbody></table><div style="clear: both;"> <p> </p> </div> <p><strong>Breeding from selection of animals, to weaning of the young rabbits</strong></p> <p>In rabbits, males are referred to as &#39;Bucks&#39; and a females as &#39;Does&#39; and their young are referred to as &#39;kits; &#39;kit&#39; is an abbreviation of &#39;kitten&#39;. It is important that you plan your breeding, otherwise you could end up with more weanlings than you can cope with. It is very easy to get over crowded very quickly as rabbits are very prolific breeders. Plan how many weanlings you want to have in a year and how many does you need to reach that goal. One doe can have 4 - 5 nests per year with each time up to 8 kits. When they all stay alive one doe is able to provide you with up to 40 weanlings per year. </p> <p>It is advisable to keep a breeding sheet on the door of each doe pen. You should record the number of the doe, the date of birth, date of service, the buck used, the date of kindling (giving birth), number of kits reared, any deaths, as well as dates of <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="deworming">deworming</span> (You could include a column for &#39;comments&#39; on the far right of the sheet - i.e., whether the doe adopted another&#39;s young or, indeed, had so many kits that she had to foster some of them).</p> <p><br><strong>Example of headings on breeding sheet: </strong></p> <p>It is suggested that these should be posted on the door of every breeding doe, protected by a plastic bag and stapled where the rabbit cannot destroy it. Every breeding doe and buck should have a name and number, which would be at the top of the sheet.

In cold climates the rabbits will curl up to keep warm and in hot weather they will stretch out (with the back legs stretched out behind them) so that they can lose as much heat as possible by radiation and convection.<br>At the same time their ear temperature will increase for cooling the blood. The ideal temperature is from 10degC - 26degC. They are able to survive in temperatures as low as 0degC and as high as 33degC but their efficiency will be compromised at these temperatures.</p> <p>Heat regulation of newborn rabbits is, however, different. Kids are born blind, naked and helpless; and it is interesting to note that they are born with teeth. To keep warm they huddle together in a nest made by the mother with fur from her chest. If the temperature rises, the kits will move apart. A sudden drop in temperature can disable their temperature control before they can huddle together again, and a kit can die of cold 10 cm away from the group. The breeder must be watchful for such instances.<br>Rabbits are sensitive to humidity below 55%. They feel comfortable if the humidity level ranges from 60 - 70%. The problem arises during the rainy season when temperatures and <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="humity">humity</span> fluctuate. Air which is too hot and dry is even more dangerous. This is why it is so important to have sufficient ventilation without <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="draughts">draughts</span>.<br><br><strong>Gestation Period:</strong> On the average 30 - 32 days and the rabbits born on any day between the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="28th">28th</span> and <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="34th">34th</span> day after mating, usually survive. The duration of gestation is also affected by the time of year, the size of the doe and, above all, the size of the litter.<br><br><strong>Pseudo Pregnancy:</strong> A doe may exhibit <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="pseudopregnancy">pseudopregnancy</span> (behaves as if pregnant when it is not) but the symptoms do not usually last beyond the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="18th">18th</span> day. The best way to confirm pregnancy is to palpate the abdomen gently on the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="10th">10th</span> - <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="14th">14th</span> day.<br><br><strong>Mating:</strong> When a doe is ready to be mated she may become restless and nervous and may have a red and swollen vulva and will be happy to join the bucks. Rabbits are spontaneous <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="ovulators">ovulators</span>, so can be put in with the buck and covering will take place within minutes. A receptive doe raises her tail and allows mating. The buck will make a growling noise and fall to one side when mating has taken place. The doe should be removed immediately. If mating has not taken place in 15 minutes the doe should be removed and returned later. If left with the buck they will both become bored and the buck will lose interest.<br><br><strong>Caring for the Doe:</strong> A pregnant doe deserves special care and management if the farmer is to achieve the best results. Although the general care of the doe is the same as that for the entire flock, it involves a slightly different management strategy. Special care should be taken in respect of feeding; environment; kindling and housing as well as the diet.<br> </p> <p><strong>A balanced diet </strong>will ensure better fertilization, reduce the risk of embryonic deaths and ensure better fetal growth; see feeding for more advice also on feeding the pregnant rabbits.<br><br><strong>Miracle births</strong><br>Cases of &quot;miracle births&quot; have been observed. This takes place when a doe produces young when it is absolutely certain that she has not been to the buck. Some does who will not accept the buck may already be pregnant even though they have not been with a buck. It has also been recorded that a doe that is in kit is sometimes able to retain sperm from a different covering, to produce another litter later.<br><br><strong>Kindling:</strong> The birth of young rabbits is known as &#39;kindling&#39;. This usually takes place at night and the doe should not be disturbed by noise or frightened by animals. This can cause her to eat or abandon her litter. After birth, the mother will lick her young and let them suckle. The earlier this happens the better their chance of survival. Most does are good mothers and are very protective and careful of their litter.<br>Occasionally a doe will eat her young. There are factors that can be attributed to this, such as shortage of water before kindling, or noise and fear. If, however, she repeats this <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="behaviour">behaviour</span> with subsequent litters she should be culled because this trait can be passed on to future generations.<br><br><strong>Fostering:</strong> This means taking kits to another doe. This could be an option if a mother dies or abandons her litter or does not allow them to suckle. The other reason is if the litter is bigger than 8 kits, when it is advisable to foster the excess to mothers with less than 8 kits.<br><br><strong>Litter size and frequency:</strong> Under good management, a doe can produce 4 to 5 litters per year with 7 to 10 kits per litter. Usually smaller litters thrive better than larger ones, but larger litters can be sustained with improved feeding. It is essential, therefore, to ensure that your does receive adequate concentrate feed, plenty of green fodder, supplements and plenty of clean drinking water. It should be remembered that a doe has 8 teats. If she produces more than 8 kits the smaller kits may not receive sufficient food. It is very easy to put the weaker kits with a doe who has fewer babies of the same age. Does are very accepting of &#39;outsiders&#39;.<br><br><strong>First breeding: </strong>With good feeding practices the well-developed doe should be ready to breed at 5 months of age. With poor feeding practices this may not happen till 7 to 8 months of age. Some first time mothers will eat their first litter, or abandon them. The dead kits should be removed immediately and disposed of. The doe should be rested for at least a week before being returned to the buck. If a doe has three unsuccessful <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="breedings">breedings</span>, she should not be used for breeding and retire.</p> <p><strong><span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Breedings">Breedings</span> after wean</strong>: Mature does can be served one week after they wean.<br><br><strong>Weaning:</strong> At weaning (one month) the kits must be sexed and kept separate as they are able to breed from a very young age. If you allow your rabbits to breed too young the result will be small and weak off-spring. They could even be born with birth defects and a young mother may not be able to look after her offspring properly, or she may even eat them all at birth or she herself may die.</p> <p>If one month is gestation and one month is for rearing young, the doe could not be taken to the buck more than once in two months. But this way you could have a continuous supply of meat. Depending on how many does you keep, you can work this out:</p> <ul><li>Gestation is one month</li> <li>One month is with the mother</li> <li>3 - 4 months to slaughter.</li> </ul><p><br><strong>Production period:</strong> when does and bucks perform well, they can be kept for 4-5 years after which time their production should be assessed. If the doe is still producing decent sized litters with healthy kits, it is possible to keep her for a further year, <strong>after that she should retire and be kept as a pet</strong>. The same applies to the buck. It has been noted that older bucks may start to produce small or weak kits, <strong>in which case they should retire and kept as a pet.</strong></p> <p><br><strong>Care of the young:</strong> A couple of days before giving birth the doe will start collecting hay in her mouth to make a nest. She will then pull hair from her chest and under her neck to line the nest. She will pull out more hair after haven given birth and cover the babies. This is the time that the young have to be watched carefully:</p> <ul><li>Kits are born blind and naked. The first 35 days of their life are crucial. They are usually confined to the nest for at least two weeks, sometimes longer. They should not be separated from their mother before 4 weeks of age. If they are weaned early they may die of separation shock.</li> <li>For the first 20 days the only food for the kits is their mother&#39;s milk. The mother feeds her young only once in 24 hours and only for 3 - 5 minutes. The doe must, therefore, have access to plenty of good food and water to ensure that she has enough milk for the litter.</li> <li>It is essential that the kits not get cold, especially in the first few days after birth. The nest needs to be checked to ensure that the babies are not carried out of the nest by the mother after feeding (check early mornings as feeding normally takes place during the night). It is quite safe to handle the young and return them to the nest.</li> <li>If they are found outside the nest and cold, (the kits will feel cold and the skin will be wrinkled and &#39;sticky&#39; to the touch) it is essential to warm them up quickly or they will die.</li> <li>Once they are warm (the kits will become a healthy pink <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="colour">colour</span>, warm to the touch) they can be returned to the nest. Warming them can be done by wrapping them lightly in a cloth and putting this on top of a hot water bottle in a box. Make sure that the kits are protected from the plastic cover. They should be turned a couple of times to make sure that they are properly warm.</li> <li>They will start to squeak and wriggle once they are warm enough. Remember that every dead kit is a lost life.</li> <li>The kits will start coming out of the nest after 15 - 16 days and will start trying to chew green matter and concentrate whilst still suckling. They will gradually eat more solid food and suckle less.</li> <li>At one month the kits should be weaned and the males separated from the females as they can start breeding at a very young age. Determining the sex of the kits is not easy, but practice makes a master: Lay the kit on its back in your hand and gently blow on the hair around the genital area and, with 2 fingers, gently separate the genitalia towards the tail. The males will show a small upwards protrusion while the females will show a small opening. This is easier done by two people. One holding the kit and one doing the sexing. Kits generally lie very still when laid on their backs. It is essential that they are treated gently to avoid injury.</li> <li>The kits should then be put in separate weaning houses. A double pen of 90 x 180 cm can comfortably house 6 young rabbit growers. Remember there are now more rabbits in each cage, so they must be fed more food accordingly and given more water if they are to grow well.</li> <li>At weaning it is advisable to routinely (no preventive treatments in organic rabbit production) treat the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="weaners">weaners</span> with <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="coccidiostat">coccidiostat</span> (the same one used for chicken). 1 ml <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="dawa">dawa</span>/<span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="litre">litre</span> of water for 3 days will protect them from diarrhea and stress after weaning.</li> <li>It is also advisable to deworm them a week later with 1/4 ml of <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Albendazole">Albendazole</span> administered by mouth with a small syringe (without needle) is enough for each one month old rabbit.

If the rabbit feels insecure or afraid it will damage itself and, in all probability, the handler. <br><br>NEVER lift a rabbit by the ears. The most common and safest method is to grasp the ears close to the head with one hand, while the other hand takes the full weight of the rabbit. The hand holding the ears restrains the rabbit and prevents it from struggling, without damaging the joints where the ears meet the head.<br><br>When handling kits, they should be picked up by placing the whole hand, gently, over the kit and curling the fingers around it. Care should be taken not to squeeze the kit as they are very fragile and it is very easy to damage them.<br><br>When handling rabbits, of any size, for whatever reason, the easiest and safest way is to wrap the rabbit in a cloth and pick it up. The cloth or sack will give the rabbit a sense of security and it won&#39;t struggle.<br><br><br><strong>Viciousness in rabbits </strong><br>It occasionally happens that a rabbit becomes vicious and attacks those who attempt to handle it. A doe may become very aggressive when she has young - this is a natural instinct and should be respected. Bucks can also become aggressive for no obvious reason. However, aggression is almost always as a result of bad handling or teasing. It can also be the result of lack of water - so make sure that water is always available.<br><br>There are instances where a rabbit may become aggressive for none of the above reasons. If this behaviour becomes habitual, culling should be considered. A rabbit has the ability to open its mouth very wide, their teeth are very sharp and their bites are deep and painful.<br> </p> <p class="rtejustify"><strong>Slaughter</strong></p> <p class="rtejustify"><strong>It is important that the rabbit is killed very quickly and in the most humane way possible</strong>.</p> <p class="rtejustify">The quickest and kindest way to do this is:</p> <ul><li class="rtejustify">Hold the rabbit in your left hand by its back legs. With your right hand hold the rabbit&#39;s head between your index and middle fingers, under the chin and against the base of the skull. Lift your right hand to shoulder height, stretching the rabbit, and pull the head quickly and sharply. If you try to do this any other way it will not work.</li> <li class="rtejustify">When the rabbit is dead, it should be hung by one back leg. The head is removed. The feet are clipped off. A small slit should be made on the inside of the back leg that is not attached to the slaughter post. The skin is peeled off this leg. The skin is then gently loosened round the body and front legs. You will then be able to take the skin off the remaining back leg, and by pulling down, so that the skin is now inside out, you will be able to peel the skin off like a sock. The rabbit is then gutted and entrails removed.</li> </ul><p class="rtejustify"> </p> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 class="rtejustify" id="simple-table-of-contents-4">Housing</h2> <p class="rtejustify">The rabbit unit should be located in a peaceful environment, away from the noise and bustle of human and animal noise.

One type is what the farmer will see on the floor of the hutch or below the cage. The other is the one that the rabbit swallows whole directly from the anus. Coprophagy is a peculiar physiological and natural habit which increases the digestive efficiency, especially from protein. The fecal pellets eaten contain three and half times more crude protein than the normal pellets which is probably why they instinctively eat these fecal pellets.</p> <p class="rtejustify">The feed <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="The process of changing the farm management from conventional to organic practices as per the organic standards. ">conversion</a> ratio of rabbit is considered to be half as efficient as that of cattle, due to the rapid rate of passage of food. More so because microbial digestion of fibre takes place in the hindgut rather than in the rumen. The digestive tract of a rabbit is known to be adapted to fibrous feed, but the hindgut is selectively able to excrete large fibre particles in feces, and retain the smaller particles. Rabbits are able to consume large amounts of forage - greens of many types - which people do not eat. They convert this forage into meat which people do eat. Anyone with fields or a garden will have maize stalks, sweet potato vines, fruit peelings, peanut vines, cabbage or lettuce leaves, carrot tops or any number of other greens in addition to lots of wild plants and kitchen garbage on which rabbits thrive. Many of these greens would otherwise go to waste. They would need, however, a bit of grain each day. If rabbits are not fed well they cannot give the best returns In large rabbit farms the bulk of expenditure incurred in breeding, producing and keeping rabbits is on concentrated feeds.<br><br>Interestingly, when available, rabbits prefer green fodder which is low in crude protein and is easily digestible. If they are forced to eat less preferred plant parts the feed intake may decrease drastically. The large capacity of the rabbits digestive organs enables it to compensate for seasonally lower concentrates in feed during cold periods and, during the warmer weather by a correspondingly higher intake. It is for this reason, accompanied by corpophagy, that the chances of survival during feed and water deficiencies are improved.<br><br>Rabbits can survive on a wide range of feed, thus enabling the keeper to adopt a feeding program to suit the prevailing local circumstances. There are different types of foodstuffs that are used as rabbit feed. On small holder farms, where pelleted feeds are not available and/or are to expensive, rabbits can produce on many kinds of available local feeds. In large rabbit farms, pelleted feed are most used which is more balanced and which will cut down on wastage.</p> <p class="rtejustify">Feeds can be grouped as:</p> <ul><li class="rtejustify">roughages, including hay, green leaves and weeds. As a precaution, if wild herbs are to be offered, a knowledge of poisonous plants is necessary.</li> <li class="rtejustify">succulent foodstuffs, including green grass, carrots and other green food</li> <li class="rtejustify">concentrates, including all cereals </li> <li class="rtejustify">compounded feeds such as complete pelleted feed<br> </li> </ul><p>Rabbits require different quantities of food at different stages of growth. In Table 1 is shown that rabbits producing milk and pregnant rabbits needs most feed (protein and minerals). Non-producing rabbits have least requirements. The amount of feed what should be supplied depends on the type of feed. A lactating doe will need 350g - 380g concentrates per day. When fed with green fodder, she needs much more and up to 1.5 kg (and takes with that feed also a lot of water). When hay is fed (with a lower energy content) she needs to eat 700 grams a day or more.</p> <p>A pregnant doe requires 0.60 Mj digestible energy. That can be eaten in the form of green forage or as concentrates or as a mixture of both types of feed. Concentrated feed can be grains or other feed with a high feeding value (low moisture content). The maximum intake of a pregnant doe is about 600 grams of dry matter per day. From concentrates with 90% dry matter the doe will eat 660 grams to satisfy her needs. From fresh green grass with 25% dry matter, the doe has to take 2400 grams to ingest 600 grams of dry matter. That is a too big amount and part of the ration should consist of high dry matter feed (e.g. grains) According to table 1, the 600 grams dry matter should roughly contain 90 grams of crude protein, 12 grams of crude fat, 80 grams of crude fibre, 3 grams of lysine, 6 grams of calcium and 4 gram of phosphorus.

The most food and water efficient food bowls are made of clay with an inward lip. These are too heavy for the rabbits to turn over and the lip prevents spillage. The water bowls should be scrubbed at least once a week to prevent algae growing. This will foul the water.<br><br><strong>NOTE: Do not feed rabbits with tops of tomato or Irish potato nor with mint as they are poisonous.</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Feeding Time</strong></p> <p>Rabbits are very &#39;time conscious&#39;! They expect food at the appointed time and you may find them waiting by their doors at that time. A haphazard feeding schedule will cause distress to their digestive system. It is best to feed them twice a day: morning and evening.<br> </p> <p><strong>Cleanliness and Hygiene</strong></p> <p>Feed, bedding and water should all be fresh. If concentrates are fed they should be stored in weather/vermin proof containers (drums with lids and old deep freezes make excellent feed stores). Keeping the feeders and water bowls clean can yield dividends to a farmer. Failure to maintain hygienic conditions will result in frequent disease outbreaks.<br>Tip: A spray bottle of 50/50 white vinegar and water makes a gentle <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="To reduce, by physical or chemical means, the number of potentially harmful microorganisms in the environment, to a level that does not compromise food safety and suitability.

It is wrong to assume that rabbits obtain sufficient water from their green food. Rabbits consume a surprising amount of water and it is important that this is readily available. Place a small water bowl with a solid base to avoid being overturned in each cage, and fill the bowl with water twice a day. Alternatively, in large enterprises a drip water system could be useful. This is more expensive, it saves time, the rabbits have water at all times they learn very quickly how to use it</p> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 class="rtejustify" id="simple-table-of-contents-6">Common Rabbits Diseases</h2> <p class="rtejustify">Good health in the rabbitry comes from keeping the environment clean, dry and well-ventilated and avoiding overcrowding.<br><br>The problem of disease is two fold in domestic rabbits. The first and most important part is prevention, the second concerns elimination and treatment of disease when it occurs.

Complete isolation of sick rabbits is essential. Early treatment is the only effective method of dealing with disease. A decision has to be made as to whether the rabbit can be saved and, if it can, is it financially viable to do so. If the rabbit is to be destroyed, it should be done humanely, away from the rabbit unit, and the carcass should be incinerated without cutting it up as this could spread bacterial infections through the unit.<br>A farmer may well be able to diagnose the problem, but it is advisable to seek veterinary advice in the event of a disease outbreak. Prevention and treatment of common disease, along with hygienic measures are necessary to avoid outbreaks. One can often draw conclusions from the symptoms with regard to the location and type of disease, along with the chances of recovery.<br><br>Early recognition of disease is most important as there is more chance of recovery if the treatment is started early. It is quite useless to commence treatment when the disease has progressed to the stage that the rabbit is obviously dying. A watchful rabbit keeper will be quick to notice any change in appearance of any of his stock.</p> <ul><li class="rtejustify">A fall in weight is one of the first signs that all is not well.

">Canker</a> and Mange are caused by two types of mites - <em>Posroptes communis</em> var. <em>cuniculi </em>and <em>Chorioptes cuniculi</em>. The mites attack the inside of the ear and cause inflammation and severe irritation. The animal will be restless and will shake its head from side to side. It is possible that the ears will become damaged from banging against the side of the pen. This can lead to &#39;cauliflower&#39; ear which look like bubbles under the skin on the inside of the ear.

It is a tender meat and cooks very quickly. If the meat is being sold into butcheries or restaurants, it should be well presented and it is essential the carcasses have been cleaned properly. This can be done in three ways:</p> <div class="rtejustify">1. Lie the rabbit on its side. Push the back legs into the empty cavity and under the breast bone.
