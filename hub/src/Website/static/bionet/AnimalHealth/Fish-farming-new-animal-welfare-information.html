id="simple-table-of-contents-1">Introduction - fish are also animals</h2> <div> <div> <div>As humans, we are likely to think of fish as either a resource (even sometimes an unlimited resource), especially the wild fish which we can catch and eat, or a commodity, in terms of farmed fish. But fish themselves are animals, as should as such also be treated well and with minimum stress and pain. It is still under discussion whether and how fish feel pain, but there is no doubt that they react to stimuli as if they feel pain. This means that we should be fair to the fish and handle them gentle, when handling them. Use nets with no knots; hold them gently and preferably under the water, if we catch them to inspect them under farmed conditions, and when catching them: kill them immediately and efficiently. Like with all animals, we should allow them to perform their species-specific behavior. Some fish are living in groups and some are solitaire or have territories. They will have different requirements for shade and living conditions, e.g. hiding or exploring. Another aspect of fish life is their participation in very fine food webs: life in an aquatic environment is based on fine balances of fish eating plants, plankton, (both plant and zoo plankton), and each other. This balance should be supported and kept, if we as humans want to enjoy the privilege to catch and eat fish. When farming to the organic principles, it is of vital importance to respect all living creatures, including fish.</div> <div> </div> <div><a href="animal-health-promotion-welfare-and-disease-prevention.html"><font color="#000080">For more information on Animal Welfare and Organic Certification Norms see here</font></a></div> <div> </div> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-2">Fish in organic farms - organic norms and standards regarding fish farming</h2> <p>The IFOAM norms and standards also cover fish and aquatic farming, and defines aquaculture as &#39;The managed production of aquatic plants and/or animals in fresh, brackish or sal water in a circumscribed (demarcated) environment. Organic aquaculture follows the same general rules as all other organic animals regarding feeding, breeding and human management. In addition, the following requirements should be met, when establishing or converting to organic aquaculture:</p> <p>6.1.2 The <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="The time between the start of the organic management and the certification of animal husbandry as organic. ">conversion period</a> of the production unit shall be at least one life cycle of the organism or one year, whichever is shorter.</p> <p>6.1.3 Operators shall ensure that <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="The process of changing the farm management from conventional to organic practices as per the organic standards. ">conversion</a> to organic aquaculture addresses environmental factors, and past use of the site with respect to waste, sediments and water quality.</p> <p>6.1.4 Production units must be located at an appropriate minimum distance from <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Pollution of organic product or land; or contact with any material that would render the product unsuitable for organic certification. ">contamination</a> sources and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Refers to any material, production or processing practices that is not certified organic or organic in-conversion. ">conventional</a> aquaculture.</p> <p>In aquatic ecosystems, the biodiversity of natural aquatic ecosystems should be considered, as well as the health of the aquatic environment, and the quality of surrounding aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, This means that all relevant organic requirements regarding ecosystem management shall be met, and e.g. introduced and cultivated species should not escape out to the surrounding environment. Waste and nutrients should also not be let into the natural environment, and clearly all artificial fertilizers and pesticides are prohibited.</p> <p>With regard to breeding of organic fish, their life should start in an organic unit. It can be permitted to buy in non-organic fish to an organic farming system, given that they will spend at least two thirds of their lives there, and die to the norms, artificially polyploided organisms or artificially produced monosex stock shall not be used. Only breeds and breeding techniques suited to the region should be used.</p> <p>The general principle of feeding is that &#39;<em>Organic aquatic animals receive their nutritional needs from good quality, organic sources&#39;, </em>that is, they shall be fed organic feed. Until 31<sup>st</sup> Dec. 2014, a limited amount of non-organic feed can be used if there is no organic feed available, and in areas where organic aquaculture is not well established yet.</p> <p>Use of water containing human excrement is prohibited, as it can mean transfer of certain diseases.</p> <p>Feeding fish is a challenge, because some of them would live from fish and smaller animals in nature, and therefore they should be fed with these animals, although they can grow and seem fine on being fed with plant products.</p> <p> </p> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-3"> Aquatic animal health and welfare</h2> <p>The general principle for animal health and welfare for aquatic animals is very much similar to that of other animals: &#39;<em>Organic management practices promote and maintain the health and well-being of animals through balanced organic nutrition, stress-free living conditions appropriate to the species and breed selection for <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Ability of a living organism not to get affected by a disease or pest; or of a pest not to be affected by a pesticide. [br][br] Pesticide Resistance is the ability of a life form to develop a tolerance to a pesticide. Pests (weeds, insects, mites, diseases, etc.) that become resistant to a pesticide will not be affected by the pesticide. When pests are resistant, it is more difficult to control the pest. Therefore, it is important to try to prevent pesticide resistance. ">resistance</a> to diseases, parasites and infections. </em></p> <p>The same rules for use of veterinary medicine applies for fish, such as medicine for prevention is prohibited, and the first choice should be natural methods and medicines. Use of chemical allopathic veterinary drugs and antibiotics is prohibited for invertebrates (other aquatic animals than fish, e.g. shrimps). <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Manufactured by chemical and industrial processes. May include products not found in nature, or simulation of products from natural sources (but not extracted from natural raw materials). ">Synthetic</a> hormones and growth promoters are prohibited for use to artificially stimulate growth and reproduction. Stocking density must not compromise animal welfare; this should be adjusted to age and breed of fish. Apart from this, it is said (Norms 6.6.6): &#39;<em>Operators shall routinely monitor water quality, stocking densities, health, and behavior of each cohort (school) and manage the operation to maintain water quality, health, and natural behavior&#39;. </em></p> <p>When organic aquatic animals are transported and slaughtered, they should be subjected to minimum stress, and their species specific needs shall be respected, like with all other animals. The operator shall handle live organisms in ways which are compatible with their physiological requirements. Requirement 6.7.3 furthermore states:</p> <p><em>Operators shall implement defined measures to ensure that organic aquatic animals are provided with conditions during transportation and slaughter that meet animal specific needs and minimize the adverse effects of (a) diminishing water quality, (b) time spent in transport; (c) stocking density, (d) toxic substances; (e) escape. </em> </p> <p>Aquatic vertebrates (fish) shall be stunned before killing, and it should be ensured that the equipment for this is sufficient to remove sensate ability and/or kill it.</p> <p> </p> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-4">Aquaculture</h2> <p class="rtejustify">Aquaculture refers to the farming (propagation and rearing) of aquatic (water dwelling) organisms that include fin fish, mollusks, crustaceans and aquatic plants in controlled or semi controlled environments. The farming activities involve interventions such as stocking, feeding and protection from diseases and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects.

Although aquaculture is a fairly new concept in Kenya, it has a long history in Asia and Europe. It is believed to have started in China as early as 500 BC.</div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify">There are many different species cultured. The different species have different biology and therefore different ecological requirements. They will therefore have different feeding, breeding and water quality requirements. Coupled with different management and intensification levels used, aquaculture production is very varied and diverse.</div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify"> <h2 class="rtejustify" id="simple-table-of-contents-5" style="clear: both;">Aquaculture in Kenya</h2> <div class="rtejustify" style="clear: both;">In Kenya, resources have been spent to promote aquaculture development through various aquaculture projects over the last few decades. The promotion started in the early 1920s as a means of supplementing protein sources in the rural areas. This was a non-commercial approach and it was promoted only as a family subsistence activity. This has however changed over the years and many investors have now invested in commercial aquaculture.</div> <div class="rtejustify" style="clear: both;"> </div> <div class="rtejustify" style="clear: both;">Majority of aquaculture activities in Kenya involves the production of various species of tilapia (mainly <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em>) and the African catfish (<em>Clarias gariepinus</em>) and Rainbow trout. The tilapia and catfish production is mainly done as mono or polyculture of the two under semi-intensive systems using earthen ponds while the Rainbow trout production is done in intensive raceways and tank systems. The Tilapine species constitute about 90% of aquaculture production in Kenya. Although most of the production targets the food fish market, there has been an increasing demand for baitfish for the Nile Perch capture of Lake Victoria. Several entrepreneurs are producing the catfish juveniles for this market. Ornamental fish production is also gaining interest and several producers are engaged in the production of gold fish and koi carp among other ornamental species.</div> </div> <div class="rtejustify"><img src="../res/res/files/2894.600x500.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify">Percentage production by species<br>(c) Mbugua Mwangi</div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 60%;"><tbody><tr><td class="rtejustify"><img src="../res/res/files/2893.500x400.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td class="rtejustify">Number of production units by province</td> </tr><tr><td class="rtejustify"> <p>(c) Mbugua Mwangi</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><div class="rtejustify"> <br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/2892.500x400.png" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Number of farmers by province</td> </tr><tr><td>(c) Mbugua Mwangi</td> </tr></tbody></table></div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify" style="clear: both;"> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 60%;"><tbody><tr><td> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/2891.500x400.png" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;">Area under aquaculture by province (Ha)</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Mbugua Mwangi</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table></td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p>There are two broad aquaculture divisions in Kenya:</p> <ul><li><strong>Marine aquaculture </strong></li> <li><strong>Fresh water culture</strong></li> </ul></div> <p>With an Indian Ocean coastline of about 600 km, mariculture is yet to realise any sensible development and therefore fresh water culture dominates aquaculture activities.<br><br>Fresh water aquaculture can be divided into:</p> <ul><li><strong>Cold water culture</strong> involving culture of Rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus</em> mykiss) in highland areas </li> <li><strong>Warm water culture</strong> involving the culture of Tilapine fishes, the African catfish, common carp and a variety of ornamental fishes in low land regions of the country</li> </ul><p class="rtejustify"><br>The total area under aquaculture in Kenya stands at 722.4 ha which include culture-based fisheries.

In the first year of the program, over 27000 fish ponds were dug; 200 ponds in each of 140 constituencies countrywide. This alone created a national short-term demand of about 28 million certified tilapia and catfish fingerlings and over 14,000 metric tonnes of formulated fish feeds. The multiplier effect resulting from farmers digging their own ponds is expected to increase the demand for fingerlings to over 100 million and the demand for fish feeds to 100,000 MT in the medium term (Charo-Karisa and Gichuri, 2010).</p> </div> </div> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-6">Considerations before investing in organic aquaculture</h2> <div> <div> <div>Starting aquaculture as an economic enterprise, should be taken seriously.

Remember that economic considerations are as important as biological considerations in aquaculture. Socio-legal issues are potentially capable of limiting or even making it completely impossible to undertake aquaculture production.<br><br>It is essential to ascertain that the business concept is sound. Ask whether: </p><ul><li>There are adequate and profitable markets for proposed product(s): you can sell all the fish you are going to produce at a good price</li> <li>You have a suitable site for the proposed production: you have a good place were the pond can be established.</li> <li>You have enough resources to meet the projected targets: you have enough money or can get loans to pay all the investments and the startup costs.</li> <li>Your financial projections are realistic, robust and consistent: you can survive a period with low prices or low yields as expected.</li> <li>You have the expertise to produce: you know how to produce fish in an animal friendly way or know somebody who can help you with it.</li> <li> You can get adequate essential support services: you are sure that people you relay on, will be able to help you</li> <li>Your proposed undertaking is in accordance with organic principles, meets all the organic regulations, meets environmental, social and legal requirements: in your fishpond the fish has a good life, it does not pollute the surroundings, does not cause trouble with the neighbors and meets all community and country laws and regulations.</li> </ul><p><br>These questions should be answered in a well thought out BUSINESS PLAN and will provide you with a written document to serve as an overall plan for your operations.<br> <br></p><div style="clear: both;"><strong>Business planning</strong></div> <p> Business planning is important to both new and established aquaculture enterprises.

Surprisingly this question is asked very often by very many producers deep into their production cycle. Others ask this question after they have harvested their fish. Serious producers should ask and get answers to this question well before they go into production.<br> </p><div>Marketing is normally overlooked by many entrepreneurs and yet aquaculture production, like any other serious investment, should target specific market(s). Indeed for any aquaculture enterprise to be successful, it must target a specified market or markets.</div> <div>Any serious entrepreneur will produce goods which match the needs and wants of the customers they wish to serve. Therefore, one must make a decision on what to produce based on what the market wants.</div> <div>Therefore, to avoid uncertainties and eminent failure, the first questions that an investor must ask and get answers to, are: </div> <ul><li>What organic products does the market demand?</li> <li>What quantities does the market demand?</li> <li>What production resources do I have?</li> <li>Can the resources meet the proposed production?</li> <li>Which organic products am I capable of producing?</li> <li>What quantities can I realistically supply?</li> <li>When does the market want them supplied?</li> <li>What quality does the market require?</li> <li>Can I meet these standards?</li> <li>Is it possible to get a bulk buyer?</li> <li>How many buyers of organic fish are there in the region</li> <li>Does the demand in the market justify the intended production?</li> <li>What prices is the market ready to pay?</li> <li>Is it cost effective to produce at the offered prices?</li> <li>What competition exists in this field and how do I deal with it?</li> <li>Are the existing physical infrastructure (roads, power telecommunication etc) sufficient to meet the marketing needs for the produce?</li> </ul><p><br>After answering these, the entrepreneur should be able to make a decision on whether to continue or abandon the proposed production. If the entrepreneur decides to go on, then, it is time to develop a marketing strategy.<br> <br></p><div style="clear: both;"><strong>Marketing strategy</strong></div> <p> A marketing strategy is a plan to achieve the financial goals of the entrepreneur. The strategy should address; the products, product prices, advertisement and where to sell as regards marketing. Ideally, the products must be sold for more than the production cost and quantities that allow the producer to make gains and remain in business.<br><br>Marketing strategy involves:<br>i. Analyzing the market situation<br>ii. Formulating marketing goals<br>iii. Evaluating and selecting suitable marketing alternatives<br><br><strong>i. Analyzing market situation</strong> <br>To do this, the entrepreneur should have a good knowledge of: </p><ul><li>Potential customer</li> <li>Modes of marketing (e.g. do you need to draw agreements, do you have to go through brokers etc)</li> <li>Product prices and their seasonality</li> <li>Product forms acceptable by the market</li> <li>Product quality requirements including regulation governing this</li> <li>Consumer preferences</li> <li>Quantity requirements</li> <li>Modes of payments and frequency</li> <li>All costs involved</li> <li>All competing products</li> <li>Alternative markets</li> <li>History regarding prices, demand, supply, product spoilage, product rejection etc</li> </ul><p><br><strong>ii. Marketing goals</strong> <br>The goals must be realistic and achievable; otherwise the producer will be groping in darkness without purpose. In formulating marketing goals, the producer must ask, and be able to answer, the following: </p><ul><li>What is the targeted production? </li> <li>Is this achievable?</li> <li>What is the size of the target market in terms of geographical extent and consumer number? </li> <li>Is it possible to reach this market?</li> </ul><p><br><strong>iii. Marketing alternatives</strong> </p><div>It is important to consider marketing alternatives to avoid disappointment where one of the target markets collapse. For the marketing alternatives chosen or considered, product volumes and size preferences, costs associated with the marketing, and relevant legislation should be considered very carefully. Alternative markets for aquaculture products to consider include: </div> <ul><li>Hotels, restaurants, retail markets and fish (sea food) shops including supermarkets: This could be out of reach of most small scale producers because they might not meet the frequency and quantity requirement of such outlets. However they can easily overcome this by forming marketing groups. </li> <li>Farm Gate Sales: Where local demand for fish is high, this offers a very good option. It removes the problems associated with taking the produce to distant markets. However it necessitates for proper storage facilities like deep freezers or cold rooms and some degree of processing and packaging.</li> <li>Sales to whole sellers, fish processors and large institutions: The advantage here is that large quantities can be disposed off at once and terms of supply and payment are normally stipulated in a legal contract. But this is only suitable for large scale producers or for farmers selling together (in a cooperative or other form of joint selling).</li> </ul><p> </p> <p> </p> <div style="clear: both;"><strong>Production techniques</strong></div> <p> When planning for commercial aquaculture, the following aspects of production must be considered very critically:<br>i. Species to be produced<br>ii. Production site<br>iii. Production technology<br><br><strong>I. Species to be produced</strong> <br>The choice of what to produce will be guided by:<br>a) Market preference<br>b) Ecological requirements of the species<br>c) Production technology of the species<br>d) Resources available to produce<br><br>The species to be produced must not only be marketable but also suited for the climate and be produced cost effectively. Different species require different climatic conditions to perform optimally. For example:<br> </p><ul><li>Nile tilapia and African catfish require warm water of more than 25degC to achieve high growth potential. Growth of these fish is quite slow at elevations greater than 1600 meters because the water temperatures are very low. For best performance, average water temperatures of about 28degC are best. In Kenya, such regions are to be found in low land areas. In areas where temperatures are lower, a larger pond surface area can compensate for that. High sunlight intensity is also preferred for tilapia culture under semi-intensive production.</li> <li>Trout require cold<span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><font color="#000000">, </font></span>fast flowing clean water of less than 18degC for growing out and below 10degC for hatchery production. Such conditions in Kenya are to be found in high altitudes areas.</li> </ul><p><br>It is also important to know whether the species selected for production is adaptable to intended culture conditions and there is adequate knowledge of the reproductive biology, nutritional requirements, common diseases and parasites of the species. Also important is to ascertain that the species proposed for production is being profitably produced at commercial levels by other producers.<br>Other issues to consider, which are equally important are: </p><ul><li>Is there a reliable supply of good quality juveniles at a reasonable price, for stocking? </li> <li>Are you capable of establishing your own seeds (juveniles or ova) production capacity?</li> <li>Is there quality feed for the species and are the prices cost effective?</li> <li>Do you have a reliable and affordable source for specialized production supplies and equipment?</li> </ul><p><br>A good species should have the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>Adaptable to culture conditions</li> <li>Fast growth rate, from egg to market size</li> <li>Simple and inexpensive dietary requirements</li> <li>Hardiness and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Ability of a living organism not to get affected by a disease or pest; or of a pest not to be affected by a pesticide.

Production technology</strong> </p><p>The different species cultured have each their ecological requirements: feeding and breeding as well water quality. Aquaculture is done at different management and intensification levels. On small-holder farms it will mainly be in earthen ponds but even on a small scale the requirements and needs of the fish must be met and the production must add to the economics of the household. The choice of the production level will depend on:</p> <ul><li>The species of choice</li> <li>Availability of the needed technology</li> <li>Potential prices of fish</li> <li>Available resources </li> <li>Available capital</li> <li>Availability of essential inputs for example feeds, power, skilled labour, professional expertise etc. </li> </ul><p><br>Depending on the proposed targets and the resources available, the producer will make a choice for an extensive or an intensive system:<br> <br></p><div style="clear: both;"><strong>Extensive systems</strong></div> <p>In these systems little or no input is used in the production. Fish are stocked in cages, still water earthen ponds and other water impoundments (for example <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="is a place where a great stock of anything is accumulated ">reservoir</a>s) and let to fend for themselves. Low costs (recourses and labor), low stocking densities and thus low yields characterize the systems. The main cultured species are Tilapines (e.g. <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em>), <em>Clarias gariepinus</em> and <em>Cyprinus carpio</em>. These are low input-low out put production systems. Majority of the small scale, subsistence fish farmers in rural Kenya fall in this category. Production in these systems ranges between 500 and 1500 Kg/Ha/year. These systems can be organic because they don&#39;t use chemical fertilizers and artificial feed. The fish can be sold on the local market.</p> <p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 80%;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/2902.400x300.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Fish culture cages</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Mbugua Mwangi</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 80%;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/2909.400x300.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Small Scale Fish Farm.</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Mbugua Mwangi</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p><strong>Semi-intensive systems</strong><br>These systems form the bulk of aquaculture production in Kenya. In these systems still water earthen ponds and cages are used as holding units for fish culture. Still water pond culture uses the natural productivity of the water to sustain the species under culture. However to enhance productivity, the ponds are fertilized using both chemical and organic fertilizers at varying proportions to enhance productivity. Exogenous feeding using cereals bran and other locally available feeds is done to supplement pond productivity. Polyculture of <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em>, <em>Clarias gariepinus</em> and <em>Cyprinus carpio</em> is practiced with various combinations of species.<br>Commercial production in these systems ranges between 1 to 3 Kg/m2/year depending on the management levels individual farmers employ.

This allows higher stocking densities. The systems require good supply of good quality water. Less land is required to produce the same quantity of fish as compared to extensive and semi-intensive systems. The systems employ mainly raceways, various types of tanks and floating cages as holding units. In these systems, more fish are produced per unit area by complementing or substituting the productivity in the culture units by feeding from outside using complete feeds (the feeds are specifically manufactured for the species under culture) and water aeration. Such operations require high initial capital investment and high operational cost.</p> <p>They are mainly suited for high value fish. There are very few such operations in Kenya and most of them produce Rainbow trout. Production in these systems range from 10 to 50 kg/m2/year. This depends on the management levels employed by individual producers. This production can go higher with better management and quality feeds. </p> <p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 80%;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/2907.400x300.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Simple floating cage</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Mbugua Mwangi</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 80%;"><tbody><tr><td><img src="../res/res/files/2896.400x300.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>A paddle wheel aerator in action in an intensive fish farm i</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Mbugua Mwangi</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table></div> </div> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item even"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-7">Economic analysis for proposed aquaculture venture (advanced)</h2> <div> </div> <div style="clear: both;"><strong>Viability Analysis</strong></div> <div>One way of evaluating whether an opportunity such as a new aquaculture investment is worthwhile in the long-term, or to choose between aquaculture opportunities which vary in size, is by use of capital budgeting. Popular methods of capital budgeting include net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR). Pay-back period (PBP) and the break even point (BEP) are also used as indicators of feasibility of investments.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>Net Present Value</strong> (NPV) is used in the analysis of the profitability of an investment or project to give indication of the today&#39;s value of what will be earned in future. It is the futures net cash inflows discounted to today&#39;s value. If the NPV of a prospective project is positive, the project is profitable but if it is negative, the project should be abandoned because cash flows will also be negative. The higher the NPV value, the more profitable an investment is.</div> <p><br><br>NPV is given as:</p> <div style="clear: both;"> </div> <table align="left" style="width: 50%; line-height: normal;"><tbody><tr><td><img height="95" src="../res/res/files/2887.300x200.png" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;" width="300"></td> </tr></tbody></table><div><strong>Where:</strong><br>P = The net cash flow<br>i = The interest rate or the marginal cost of capital<br>t = Expected project life<br>INV = Initial investment</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div>In addition to the formula, net present value can be calculated easily using tables, and much easier by use of computer soft wares like the Microsoft Excel spread sheet.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>Internal Rate Of Return</strong> (IRR) indicates the estimated rate of return that a project is expected to generate to an investment. This can be viewed as the efficiency of an investment to turn profit.</div> <div> </div> <div>IRR is the <strong>interest rate</strong> at which the NPV is zero. It equates the present value of the expected future cash flows or receipts to the initial investment. Equation used for IRR is that for NPV, it is solved for i, the interest rate at which NPV = 0.</div> <div> </div> <div>IRR can be calculated easily by use of computer software like the Microsoft Excel spread sheet.</div> <div> </div> <div>When evaluating possible investments options, it is important to remember that the NPV method is better that the IRR. The major limitation of IRR measurement is that it uses one single discount rate to evaluate every investment. However, discount rates do change significantly and therefore without modification, IRR evaluation will not be adequate for long-term projects for which discount rates are expected to vary.</div> <div> </div> <div>Pay Back Period (PBP) is the time required to recover the cost of an investment through the net cash revenues it generates. It is calculated by dividing the initial investments cost by the accumulated profits before depreciation. However, this analysis does not take into consideration cash flow after the payback period. This method should only be used therefore as a first approach at the initial stages of evaluation to give an indication of the payback period and may not be relied upon to rank investments on basis of viability. PBP is given as:</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>PBP=I/E</strong> <br><br><strong>where:</strong> <br><strong>PBP = payback period in years</strong> <br><strong>I = initial investment</strong> <br><strong>E = Accumulated profits before depreciation</strong></div> <div> </div> <div><strong>Break even Point</strong> (BEP) describes how much a project must produce to cover for the total cost of production. At the BEP, the revenue generated by a project equals the total cost incurred. An investor will need to know this to weigh this against production possibilities available. However, this method like the PBP should only be used as a first approach before proper evaluation is conducted because it does not show profitability of projects.</div> <div> </div> <div><em>BEP considers the Economics of Scale which means the quantity of fish needed to be produced and sold at the current market price to pay all cost of the operation and make enough profit for the owner. In general the smaller the system, the more it costs to build and operate per quantity produced. This is because certain fixed costs remain the same no matter how much fish are produced.</em></div> <div> </div> <div>For aquaculture investment, BEP can be derived for production quantities and produce prices. BEP analysis for production quantities is derived by calculating how much an enterprise should produce per hectare, considering the estimated market prices for the products, to be able to cover for the total production cost.

High revenues alone do not necessarily translate into profits for the investor. A project must have the ability to clear all of its expenses and costs. These ratios are used to assess a business&#39;s ability to generate earnings as compared to costs incurred during a specific operation. They provide a comparison of profits generated and what have been invested in a project. For most of these ratios, having a higher value is an indication that the investment is good. Such ratios will include <strong>return on investment, return on equity, return on asset and operating profit margin ratio.</strong></div> <p><br>i).

Some of these aspects can be very volatile and their changes might have enormous effects on the profitability of projects. For investors to be able to make choices on where and how to invest, they need to know how likely variations on production output, cost of inputs or even changes in the market prices for the products will affect their future cash flows and net incomes. </p> <div>To be able to carry out a proper sensitivity analysis, an entrepreneur needs the following information for each of the investment type:</div> <p>Capital investment costs estimates:</p> <ul><li>a) Cost of land</li> <li>b) Cost of construction of buildings and fish production facilities </li> <li>c) Cost of acquisition of equipment and machinery</li> </ul><p>Operational investment that included the cost incurred during production.

It is therefore important to find out in general terms, the costs and returns of the proposed aquaculture venture before investment is done. To do this, you need to do a <strong>budget</strong> of your <strong>enterprise</strong> to see how it will operate. An <strong>enterprise budget</strong> provides information on annual cost, annual returns and capital investment requirements for a particular enterprise. Many farmers budget in their heads and end up making wrong decisions. Good budgets should be written so that they can be reviewed as times goes by.

For example, if a farmer buys equipment for KShs 10,000 and expects it to have a useful life of 10 years, it will be depreciated over 10 years.

A cash flow budget is an estimate of all cash receipts and all cash expenditures during a certain time period. Estimates are made monthly, bimonthly, quarterly or annually. Estimates can include non-farm income and expenditures as well as farm items. Cash flow budgeting looks only at money movement, not at profitability. Non-cash revenue or non-cash expenses, for example depreciation, are not considered.</div> <div>A cash flow budget is a useful management tool because it:</div> <ul><li>Makes you to think through your production and marketing plans for the year.</li> <li>Tests farming plans: will it be possible to produce enough income to meet all cash needs?</li> <li>Projects need for operating credit and ability to repay borrowed funds.</li> <li>Projects when to borrow money and when to repay.</li> <li>Helps in control of finances. By comparing the budget to actual cash flow, one can spot developing problems due to an unexpected drop in income or unplanned expenses, and opportunities to save or invest funds if net cash flow is higher than expected. </li> <li>Helps communicate farming plans and credit needs to lenders.</li> </ul><p> </p> <div>Items to be included in a cash flow budget include:</div> <ul><li>Receipts from sales</li> <li>Operating cash expenses</li> <li>Living expenses</li> <li>Other expenses e.g. Personal withdrawals</li> <li>Debt interests and payments </li> <li>Capital sales</li> <li>Capital purchases</li> <li>Income tax payments</li> </ul><p> </p> <div>Each type of revenue is charged during the specific period when it is occurred.</div> <div>Cash flows differ depending on the purpose for which the analysis is being developed.

Under culture they tend to mature early. Sexual features distinguishing males from females are clear when fish mature (about 15 cm in <em>Tilapia zillii</em> and 10 cm in <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em>). Males have two orifices situated near the ventral (anal) fin, one is the urinogenital aperture and the other is the anus. The females have three orifices, the genital opening the anus and a urinary orifice (but difficult to visualize with the naked eyes).

Metabolic rate rises at higher temperatures which lead to death. </div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify"><strong>Optimal Dissolved Oxygen (DO)</strong> <br>Tilapias are able to tolerate low levels of ambient oxygen. Usually, well fertilized ponds will have low levels of oxygen early in the morning. Night activities are dominated by respiration and decomposition which reduce DO. Larger fish are less tolerant than juveniles. This could be due to the difference in their metabolic demand.

They are grown in fertilized ponds where the fish utilize natural foods from ponds. Management practices of the systems ranges from extensive; using only organic or inorganic fertilizers, to intensive systems, using high-protein feed, aeration and water exchange. The major problem to overcome in this system is the prolific breeding of the fish that occur in ponds under mixed sex culture. This breeding if not controlled results to overcrowding in the ponds. The end result is stunted growth yielding small size fish (less than 100 g) which may not be of market value. In mixed-sex populations, the biomass of juveniles can make up to 70 percent of the total harvest weight. Therefore strategies for producing tilapia in ponds should aim at controlling spawning and recruitment.</div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify">For easy management and economical operation in Kenya, grow out ponds should be about 1 to 2 metres deep and at least 300 sq metres for semi-intensive production of tilapia. A harvesting sump in the pond behind the drainage outlet is needed to concentrate the fish in the final stage of drainage. The pond should be drained completely and be allowed to dry to eradicate any fry or fingerlings that may interfere with the next production cycle. This will also kill some parasites, frogs&#39; egg and other unwanted organisms that may be in the ponds.</div> <p class="rtejustify"> </p> <p class="rtejustify"><strong>Mixed-sex culture</strong> </p> <div class="rtejustify">Under mixed-sex culture of tilapia, both males and female are cultured together but harvested before or soon after they reach sexual maturity. This minimizes chances of recruitment and overcrowding. The disadvantage in this is that fish are harvested at a smaller size due to the limited growth period. In this culture practice, fish are usually stocked at low rates to reduce competition for food and promote rapid growth. One month-old, 1-gram fry are stocked at 1 to 2 per square meter and grown for about 4 to 5 months. In cold areas where the water temperatures are low and therefore growth is slow, tilapia might not reach marketable sizes in that period.</div> <div class="rtejustify"> </div> <div class="rtejustify">Newly-hatched fry should be used all the time because older ones will reach sexual maturity at a smaller, unmarketable size. They could also be mature fish but stunted. Supplemental feeds with 25 to 32 percent protein are generally used. The average harvest weight is about 250 g and total production about 0.25 kg/sq m for a stocking rate of 1 fish/m2. Higher stocking densities can be employed to achieve higher production but must be combined with very good management. Expected survival is about 80 percent. </div> <p class="rtejustify"><br>Species such as <em>Tilapia zilli</em>, <em>T. hornorum</em>, or <em>T. mossambica</em> are not suitable for mixed-sex culture because they reach reproductive maturity at 2 to 3 months at an unmarketable size of about 30 grams. Those that are suitable for this culture are <em>O. nilotica</em> and <em>O. aurea </em>which reach reproductive maturity at 5 to 6 months. Two to three crops of fish can be produced annually in Kenya depending on the water temperatures. <br><br><strong>Mono sex culture</strong> </p> <div class="rtejustify">To overcome the problem resulting from prolific breeding of tilapia, ponds are stocked with males only because the males grow almost twice as fast as females. Male fingerlings can be obtained by three methods: </div> <ul><li class="rtejustify">Hybridization</li> <li class="rtejustify">Sex-reversal and </li> <li class="rtejustify">Manual sexing.</li> </ul><p class="rtejustify"><br>None of these methods is 100 percent effective, and a combination of methods is recommended. Hybridization can be used to produce better results of males only. The hybrids can then be subjected to hand sexing and/or sex-reversal treatment. Sex-reversal requires obtaining recently hatched fry and rearing them in tanks or hapas where they are subjected to hormone laced feed for about three weeks.</p> <p>Hormonal sex reversal needs a tank-based or hapa-based hatchery that will allow fry to be collected at the yolk sac or first feeding stages (no later than one week after they have been released from the female). The healthy fry of uniform size are transferred to the tank or hapa where you will feed them with hormone-laced diet for 21-28 days. The feed is prepared as follows:</p> <ul><li>Mix 30 - 70 mg of hormone (methyl or ethynyl testosterone) in 700 ml of 95% neutral ethanol</li> <li>Add 700 ml of hormone solution to each kg of finely ground feed then mix thoroughly and dry. At this stage you may add any needed supplements</li> <li>This feed should be kept under refrigeration if it is not going to be used immediately</li> <li>Feed the fry at a rate of 10 - 30% of body weight per day, at least four times a day for 21 - 28 days.</li> <li>The fry must eat this feed to sex-reverse</li> </ul><p class="rtejustify">This is not in accordance with the organic principles and therefore cannot be applied.</p> <p class="rtejustify"><br>Manual sexing (hand sexing) involves separating males from females by visual inspection of the external urinogenital openings. Reliability of manual sexing depends on the skill of the workers, the species to be sorted and fish sizes. Experienced workers can easily sex 20-gram fingerling <em>T. hornorum</em> and <em>T. mossambica</em>, 30-gram <em>T. nilotica</em>, and 50-gram <em>T. aurea</em>. Tilapia males are preferred for culture because they grow faster than females. Females use considerable energy in reproduction and do not eat when they are incubating eggs. All-male culture permits the use of longer culture periods, higher stocking rates and fingerlings of any age. High stocking densities reduce individual growth rates, but yields per unit area are greater. If the growing season can be extended, it should be possible to produce fish of up to 500 grams. Expected survival for all-male culture is 90 percent or greater.<br>Females included in a population of mostly male tilapia affects the maximum attainable size of the original stock in grow-out. A stocking rate of 2/m2 is commonly used in Kenya to achieve yields of 1kg/ m2. At this stocking rate the daily weight gain will range from 1.5 to 2.0 grams. Culture periods of 6 months or more are needed to produce fish that weigh close to 500 grams. There are cases in Kenya where stocking densities of 6 juveniles/ m2 is practiced with a production of up to 3kg/m2. Higher stocking densities will require water aeration and sub-optimal feeding rates may have to be used to maintain suitable water quality.<br><br><strong>Polyculture</strong> <br>In Kenya tilapia are frequently cultured with other species, mainly catfish (<em>Clarias gariepinus</em>) to take advantage of many natural foods available in ponds and to produce a secondary crop, or to control tilapia breeding. Polyculture uses a combination of species that have different feeding niches to increase overall production without a corresponding increase in the quantity of supplemental feed. Polyculture can improve water quality by creating a better balance among the microbial communities of the pond, resulting in enhanced production. <br><br>Other possible polyculture combinations that can be done in Kenya include:</p> <ul><li class="rtejustify"><strong>Tilapia and prawns</strong> (<em>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</em>): In this case, survival and growth of tilapia and prawns are independent. Feed is given to meet the requirements of the fish.

Although yields will be lower than those obtained with exogenous feeding, fertilization will reduce the quantity and expense of feeding. Application of an inorganic fertilizer high in phosphorus should be done prior to stocking fish to create an algal bloom. Tilapia productivity is stimulated mainly by an increase in phosphorus and to a lesser extent by an increase in nitrogen. The inorganic fertilizers used in Kenya are DAP (Diammonium phosphate) and CAN (Calcium ammonium nitrate) and <strong>are not allowed in organic fish farming, while animal manure is allowed</strong>. <br><br><br><br>Animal manure is widely used in Kenya in fish production in earthen ponds. The quality of manure as a fertilizer varies depending on the source animal and the quality of feed fed to the animal. Pig, chicken and duck manures increase fish production more than cow and sheep manure.

Depending on this, water will react in different ways with substances dissolved in it. It will also affect in different ways the plants and animals living in the water. The measure of the alkalinity or acidity of water is expressed by its pH value. The pH value ranges from 0 to 14, with pH 7 indicating that the water is neutral. Values smaller than 7 indicate acidity and greater than 7, alkalinity.</div> <div>Fish production can be greatly affected by excessively low or high pH. Extreme pH values can even kill your fish. The growth of natural food organisms may also be greatly reduced. The critical pH values vary according to the fish species, the size of individual fish and other environmental conditions. For example, fish are more susceptible to extreme pH during their reproductive seasons, and eggs and juveniles are more sensitive than adults. Waters ranging in pH from 6.5 to 8.5 (at sunrise) are generally the most suitable for pond fish production. Most cultured fish will die in waters with pH below 4.5 and 10 or above.
