If you suspect an animal has anthrax, you must inform the authorities immediately. Animals suspected of having died of anthrax should not be opened.</td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p><div>Anthrax is a soil-borne bacterial infection of domestic animals, wild animals, and man.</div> <div>Anthrax is caused by the spore-forming organism <em>Bacillus <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="anthracis">anthracis</span></em>. It is most common in wild and domestic herbivores - cattle, sheep, goats, camels, antelopes - but it also occurs in humans exposed to tissue from infected animals, contaminated animal products, or directly to anthrax spores. It doesn&#39;t affect chickens but it is common in ostriches.</div> <div> </div> <div>Anthrax occurs all over the world. It is more common in warm climates as spore formation only occurs when the temperature is between 20 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius, the humidity is over 60% and the pH is above 6.0. Under such conditions spore formation occurs rapidly, leading to the <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Pollution of organic product or land; or contact with any material that would render the product unsuitable for organic certification. ">contamination</a> of soil and water, where the spore may survive for years; up to 30 years in some cases. Spores are formed in the presence of oxygen. Within a carcass the organisms rapidly die. Only when they are exposed to air and oxygen do they form spores.</div> <p><br><br><strong>Mode of spread</strong> </p><div>The disease is transmitted through pastures which are contaminated by the spores. The animals may be forced during drought to graze on short grass which may be contaminated by the infected soil. Anthrax spores can remain infective in soil for many years. During this time they are a potential source of infection to grazing livestock. Grazing animals may become infected when they ingest sufficient numbers of these spores from the soil. </div> <ul><li>Feed contaminated with bone, or other meal from infected animals, can serve as a source of infection for livestock, as can hay that is heavily contaminated with infected soil. </li> <li>Infection is influenced by communal watering points. Water holes used by different species of animals are known to be a source of infection. </li> <li>Flooding may expose previously buried spores and agricultural practices may do the same.</li> <li>Tissues of infected animals may be moved by rats and carrion eaters and transfer infection. </li> <li>Raw or poorly cooked contaminated meat is a source of infection for carnivores and omnivores, including humans. </li> <li>In animals, infection is usually by eating infected grass, less commonly by breathing spore infested dust or through open wounds. In cattle, sheep and goats infection is nearly always by mouth. </li> <li>In camels and horses biting flies may transmit infection and this may explain the swellings sometimes seen on the body and legs of these species. </li> <li>Humans are fairly resistant and are infected after an occupational hazard affecting workers in tanneries. The workers may inhale spores and suffer an <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period. ">acute</a> fatal pneumonic form of anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is common among people who carry meat and other animal products from infected carcass. The bacteria can survive for several years in livestock products such as hides, wool and bones.</li> <li>Infection in humans is usually via skin abrasions or by inhalation. People handling wool, hides and skins are mostly at risk. Eating infected meat obviously carries a major risk, although rapid cooking quickly destroys the organism before the highly resistant spores have a chance to develop. There has been cases reported in Kenya where people have eaten meat from infected animals and died shortly afterwards. </li> </ul><p> </p> <div style="clear: both;"><strong>Signs of Anthrax</strong></div> <div style="clear: both;"> </div> <div>Depending on the route of infection, host factors, and potentially strain specific factors, anthrax can have several different clinical presentations. </div> <div>The anthrax bacillus produces a lethal toxin in the animals which causes accumulation of fluid (<span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="oedema"><a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Oedema is a condition of abnormally large fluid volume in the circulatory system or in tissues between the body&#39;s cells ">oedema</a></span>=swellings) and tissue damage, resulting in death from shock and kidney failure. </div> <div> </div> <div><strong>In very severe forms</strong>, there is a short illness and this makes the disease difficult to treat. The animal develops high fever, difficult breathing followed by convulsion, collapse and death.</div> <div>In ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats, the symptoms of anthrax are very sudden and severe, with death occurring within minutes to hours. There is staggering, high fever, rapid breathing, trembling, collapse, and a few convulsive movements, followed by death. Usually the animal is found dead, with bloody discharges from body openings. Rigor mortis is often absent or incomplete, with marked bloating and rapid decomposition. The blood is dark and thickened and fails to clot readily. If by mistake the <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="carcase">carcase</span> is opened it will be noticed that the spleen is greatly enlarged and the pulp soft and tarry.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>In severe forms</strong>, the disease would last about 2 - 3 days before death. The animal will appear depressed, <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="lacking energy ">listless</a> and have high fever. The mucus membranes in the eyes and gums are congested and hemorrhagic(showing blood). There is difficulty in breathing caused by edematous (watery) swelling in the throat.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>In less severe cases</strong>, some animals may survive for 1 week and others will recover. In dogs, humans, horses and pigs, the disease is usually less severe. Sometimes there may be swelling in the lower neck, chest and shoulders, especially in animals such as pigs, camels and horses. </div> <div>In both severe and less severe cases, affected cows may abort and have a reduction in milk production. The milk will be blood stained or appear yellowish in color. Infection in the alimentary tract may cause dysentery.</div> <p> </p> <p><br><br><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p> <div>In any case of sudden death anthrax must be suspected and a veterinarian informed so that a diagnosis can be made. Bloat, lightning strike, black-quarter, snakebite, and plant poisoning can also cause sudden death. <br>It is very risky for unqualified laboratory personnel to take samples of the disease. The sampling procedure should be carried out by qualified laboratory personnel only. </div> <p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/3588.500x400.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Anthrax</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Peter C.B. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Turnbull">Turnbull</span></p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><div> <p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/3952.500x400.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Anthrax</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) Peter C.B. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Turnbull">Turnbull</span></p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/3950.500x400.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Anthrax</td> </tr><tr><td>(c) Peter C.B. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Turnbull">Turnbull</span></td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/3951.500x400.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Anthrax</td> </tr><tr><td>(c) Peter C.B. <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Turnbull">Turnbull</span></td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <div>Blood from nose, mouth or anus is a tell-tale sign of Anthrax.

There may be an exaggerated response to unexpected visual, auditory or tactile stimuli. Long periods may be spent standing with a fixed staring expression, the head held low to the ground.

If you suspect an animal has Rabies, you must inform the authorities immediately.</td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <div>Rabies is is a fatal viral inflammation of the central nervous system caused by <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="Rhabdovirus">Rhabdovirus</span>. It occurs world wide and affects all warm blooded animals including man and other domestic and wild animals except birds. </div> <div>Rabies is common in both rural and urban areas. Many people are unaware of the mortal dangers associated with this terrible disease. Many people in rural areas keep dogs both as pets and for security. Because most rural people are not aware of the hazards of the disease, they have not had their dogs vaccinated. As a result lives are put at risk for the lack of simple information and a few shillings. </div> <div>Furious stage of Rabies in cattle: Salivation, dropped lower jaw and squinting can be seen on this highly exited rabid cow. Whilst pressing its head onto the fence it was producing a highly abnormal bellowing sound</div> <p><br><strong>Mode of spread</strong></p> <div>Rabies is transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal, usually through its bite. Once clinical signs appear it is almost invariably fatal.</div> <div>Rabid animals usually excrete the virus in their saliva 2 days before they show clinical signs and then throughout the course of the disease which is normally less than 10 days. On rare occasions dogs in Africa have been known to survive Rabies and to excrete the virus in their saliva for months.</div> <div> </div> <div>Transmission usually occurs when infected saliva is deposited in a bite wound. Less common routes of transmission include inhalation of infected droplets in bat infested caves and by the ingestion of an infected carrier.</div> <div>The rabies virus spreads when it is deposited in a bite wound and penetrates muscle cells where it either multiplies or becomes confined as a <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="subviral">subviral</span> particle. Within a few hours newly formed viral particles enter the <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Peripheral means secondary, minor, outer, outside ">peripheral</a> nervous system and travel along the nerve trunks to the spinal cord and brain. From the brain the virus travels along <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Peripheral means secondary, minor, outer, outside ">peripheral</a> nerves to the salivary glands.</div> <div> </div> <div>In Kenya the dog is the main transmitter of Rabies though cats and wild animals, such as jackals, can also play a part in transmission. Ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats play little part in direct transmission but their role as <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="indirest">indirest</span> transmitters can be important. The disease is of serious concern as the majority of dogs in the country are unvaccinated.</div> <div>The incubation period is both prolonged and variable. Bites close to the head result in symptoms appearing sooner than in an animal bitten, for example, on a lower hind limb. Sequestration of the virus in the area of the bite is believed to explain the occasional very long incubation periods recorded. Bites in areas with a rich blood supply are especially dangerous. In most clinical cases of Rabies the incubation period is of the order of 3 to 12 weeks, with occasional cases of periods of up to a year.</div> <p> </p> <div style="clear: both;"><strong>Signs of Rabies</strong></div> <div>The course of the clinical disease ranges from 2 to 10 days.</div> <div>There are three clinical phases: <strong>pre-symptomatic, <span data-scayt-lang="en_US" data-scayt-word="excitative">excitative</span> and paralytic</strong>. </div> <p> </p> <div>1.
