Domestication of poultry is thought to have started in South Asia, at least 2000 years ago. The Asian Red Jungle Fowl is generally assumed to be the ancestor of the modern poultry breeds, but maybe the first domestication of the fowl took place much earlier in China. Following this domestication various breeds have originated from isolated groups of poultry, partly by adaptation to the various environments or cultivation by man. Today&#39;s poultry breeds are all different based on appearance and performance.<br> </p> <div> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Understand chicken as the animals they are, information on behaviour</strong></h3> <p>Chicken are animals with a coherent social structure. If they are in groups up to 25 animals, they have a pecking order based on strength, but they can recognize up to 100 other hens. They communicate a lot both using body, tail and voice. They are hunted and eaten by many, and a large part of their alertness, communication and behavior is about <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s and e.g. warning each other against them. This emphasizes their need for being managed in a calm way. As humans, we should never make sharp, loud sounds or sudden movements, when we are with our chicken. </p> <p><br>They have a wide range of comfort and grooming behavior, such as preening (maintenance of feathers), stretching wings, and keeping themselves clean and well managed. They have a strong incentive for dust bathing, which is a way of preventing attack of external parasites and as such very important for their well-being. They will normally scavenge for feed, both for seeds, greens, vegetables and worms and other small animals. Their search for feed leads to a lot of ground-scratching and pecking, and they have a great need for this type of behavior. They have a need for sleeping and undisturbed resting, and will find the highest point to be protected. Hens can become &#39;broody&#39; which means that they are highly motivated to have chicken, and become very frustrated if they are not allowed to nest building. On the other hand, they cannot be forced to become broody; some breeds become broody more easily than others. They have a strong sense of being mothers and taking care of their small chicken and protect them. <br><br> </p> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>East African and Kenyan poultry population</strong></h3> <div style="clear: both;"> </div> <p>Village chicken production systems are mostly based on the local scavenging domestic fowl (<em>Gallus domesticus</em>), which predominates in African villages. <br><br>Kenya has an estimated poultry population of 29 million birds, with chicken forming the largest proportion. Of these 76% consist of indigenous chicken, layers 9 %, and 13% broilers. Other poultry species like ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, ostriches, guinea fowls, and quails make up 2 % of the poultry population. Poultry is one of the most important livestock enterprises in rural households where over 70% (24 million) of the country&#39;s population live and derive their livelihood. Indigenous chicken are kept by 90% of rural households while broilers and layers are mainly reared by urban and peri-urban farmers who target the ready market. Other poultry are kept by farmers with special interests.<br><br>On average, each household in Kenya keeps about 10 chickens, mainly for domestic consumption. There is a relatively high mortality because of lack of drinking water and disease control, and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s. On average, a farmer loses up to 40 percent of their stock annually due to these easily controllable challenges. With proper management practices indigenous chicken can become very productive and have a very good potential for improving the income of the owners. <br><br>Village chicken systems in rural Africa are characteristically: </p><ul><li>an indigenous and integral part of the farming systems, with short life cycles and quick turnovers </li> <li>low input production systems, the majority free range chicken</li> <li>a means of converting low-quality feed into high quality protein </li> </ul><p> <br></p><h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Hybrid layers</strong></h3> <div style="clear: both;">Hybrid layers are mostly kept near potential markets for eggs (such as cities and towns) where space is limited but readymade commercial feed are easily available. In non-organic farms, layers are often kept in individual battery cages, but organic poultry are always is free range with outdoor access. In Kenya they are often reared in deep litter houses where there is free movement and perches are provided. </div> <p> <br></p><h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Broilers</strong></h3> <p> Broilers are heavy breeds, often hybrid breeds specially bred for meat production, and bought as young chicks. In organic farms, less fast-growing broilers should be preferred, and they should have outdoor access. <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Refers to any material, production or processing practices that is not certified organic or organic in-conversion. ">Conventional</a> broiler hybrids are very fast growing birds and need specially manufactured feeds and very controlled conditions, and their bones are often weak. These breeds must be discouraged in organic farms, and they should be allowed exercise areas, preferably outside.<br><br>Generally, robust and suitable breeds should be chosen in organic herds. It is ethically right to choose animals which can both lay eggs and where the males can be used for meat production. In many industrial countries, the breeds are specific for either egg production or meat production, and this means that e.g. the males from egg producing breeds are killed just after hatching, because they are not good for meat production. This is an ethical dilemma of organic production.</p></div> </div></div></div></div><div class="field-item odd"><div class="field field-name-field-content-ah field-type-text-long field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"> <h2 id="simple-table-of-contents-2">Chicken management and raising according organic standards</h2> <p>The following are <strong>required</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Poultry or poultry products must come from chicken that have been under organic management from the second day of life.

Improved indigenous chickens for improving the local breeds can be bought from Naivasha research station in Kenya as well as from private breeders.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Brooding hens and cycle</strong> <br>In the village setting care must be taken to protect brooding hens from <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s, rodents and other forms of stress. If a brooder hen is well protected and comfortable she can easily hatch 15 eggs per sitting. A brooding cycle takes minimum 18 days after which the first eggs should start hatching. The mother will normally keep the chicks with her for a day or two before taking them to food and water. Any eggs not hatched after this will go cold and most likely not hatch. It is highly advisable to keep food and clean water available near the brooding hen during this whole period for her to hatch the maximum amount of chicks.</p> <p><br><strong>Selection of eggs for setting</strong> <br>When a hen is broody, she will start laying an egg every day. If she should have a clutch of chicken hatched at about the same time, the eggs are removed from her and carefully stored until there are enough for a whole clutch. Then they are all carefully placed in the nest so that she can sit on them until hatching. A improved nutrition can raise the average quantity of eggs laid per clutch by 100%. For a successfull hatching, the eggs must be handled carefully from laying till setting. Eggs should be stored with the broad end facing upwards, as at this end there is an air sack, through which the egg breathes. Eggs should be stored in a clean and dried place to prevent rotting. Since fertile eggs grow slowly, eggs older than 14 days should not be used for hatching. </p> <p><br><strong>Shortening of the reproductive cycle</strong> <br>By shortening the reproductive cycle, hens lay eggs earlier and double the number of clutches per hen per year. Improved management increase the survival rates of the chicks. Shortening of the reproductive cycle can be achieved by better feeding, protection from <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s and rodents, timely vaccinations and (if relevant) deworming, control of external parasites, and culling of aggressive and unproductive birds.</p> <p><br><strong>Serial hatching</strong> <br>Since fertile poultry can be used to sit on eggs continuously for two or more times by removing the chicks every time they hatch and replacing them with new eggs. Ducks can sit on 30 to 35 eggs and can be used for up to six consecutive times. In an organic farm, it is important to think about fairness in this situation, and let the hen have their offspring with them. Combining serial hatching with synchronisation (see below), more chicks will be able to hatch without using an incubator. Turkeys are also excellent chick brooders and can raise up to 50 chicks at the time. The rest of the procedure in introducing a cock for every 10 hens and the selection of the eggs is the same as with non-serial hatching.</p> <p><br><strong>Synchronised hatching </strong><br>It can be an advantage to have more clutches of chicken hatched on the same days, because it fits well with feeding and vaccination etc., and maybe also with selling the chicken later. When hens that started laying within the same week get brooding, the first hen to reach this stage can be delayed by being given one egg to sit on. This will be repeated for the second and third hens, so that all the hens are set on one day. By the time of setting, all &#39;dummy&#39; eggs should be destroyed. The time between the first hen and the last should not be more than one week. Again, in an organic farm, it is important to consider naturalness and fairness also in this situation. <br> </p> <div style="clear: both;"><strong>Brooding of purchased hybrid day old chicks </strong></div> <div style="clear: both;">Before buying the young hybrid chicks, an appropriate brooding area needs to be prepared:<br>Day old chicks need to be kept warm at all times.

However after about 12 months of laying, we can expect a period of resting or molting. In the natural life cycle of chickens this is the breeding period which should be respected. <br>Molting involves &quot;shedding&quot; of feathers from an otherwise healthy chicken. A molting chicken will appear more ragged than bald, as if the feathers are thinned out. Feathers will lack the normal shining appearance and appear spotty. Good producers molt fast, and normal molting times of layers should not greatly exceed 10 weeks. After this the layers can with good management come back to good production for a second year before they should be allowed to retire. <br> </p> <div style="clear: both;"><strong>When chicken stop laying eggs - retired chicken</strong></div> <p>Chickens lay eggs for around 4-5 years. Then they stop, they run out. They sort of go into a chick-menopause state. Chickens that are genetically bred to lay eggs (layers) will run out of their finite egg supply faster. Chickens that lay only occasionally (bantams and exotics) might lay longer as they only squirt out an egg when they feel like it. Even under the very best of conditions, at some point a chicken is going to stop laying eggs. She is going to stop being productive and when that happens you need to figure out what to do with her. Old hens do not eat like the young ones. They are on a lower metabolism.

Suitable poultry houses are important for efficient production and management. Poultry houses and shelters vary depending on availability of materials, weather and tradition. Choice of chicken housing should be based on cost, durability and usage. In organic production, outdoor access should be provided, and the hens or chicken can choose whether to be inside or outdoor. </p> <p><br><br><strong>Points to consider when selecting sites for poultry housing:</strong></p> <ul><li>Provision of dry, friable litter.</li> <li>Avoidance of key areas that can be patrolled by <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s.</li> <li>Dark areas to be avoided except for nest boxes.</li> <li>In fixed house situations, either wire mesh or stones in areas immediately outside pop holes.</li> <li>Air quality (i.e. low ammonia levels, correct humidity, correct temperature and good ventilation) plays a crucial role in health management. The position of a house can influence ranging activity and bird health. Soil type and drainage are instrumental in determining the extent of build up of soil-borne parasites.</li> <li>Locating houses on free draining, flat, shady, south facing pasture is preferable in order to minimise the build up of internal parasites and coocidial oocysts and to ensure better retention of grass cover.</li> <li>Poultry houses should have windows on either side for ventilation. In addition a hole or ridge on the roof will ensure proper ventilation and give light making it easier to work in the house. Make sure winds ventilate the house without making chicken cold. Make sure that there are no draughts. Sitting houses should be placed at right angles to the prevailing wind slightly moderates the amount of wind entering the building through the pop holes.</li> <li>Ideally, houses should be positioned in the centre of the land area, where the hens or chicken should have access, so that a series of radiating paddocks can be created around the unit. </li> <li>Accessibility during all weather conditions is an important consideration.</li> <li>Range areas bordered by dense woodland are likely to be at greater risk from predation by foxes in particular. On the other hand, trees and bushes close to the houses provide shade, windbreaks and protect birds from flying <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects.

">predator</a>s or thieves.</li> <li>It can be relevant to select a site on which the poultry house faces South or East in wet regions. In a rectangular house the end walls should face East and West to ensure that only the end walls face the hot afternoon sun.</li> <li>Cheap locally available material can be very good, and natural materials like bamboo, wood, reeds, thatch grass or clay bricks will often give good protection against heat and cold nights.</li> <li>Remove the bark from the wood to reduce the parasites load. Parasite often hide beneath the bark. </li> <li>Heat, humidity, and harmful gasses may be considerably reduced through good ventilation. High temperatures may cause deaths, a drop in egg production, low shells quality and reduced weight gain. A combination of high temperatures and high humidity may cause death in young chicks. </li> <li>Placing perches and nests inside the house to safeguard chickens against various <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects.

The provision of perches for laying birds satisfies a natural behavioural activity. Diseases and parasites may attack poultry resting on the floor (in contact with litter). Each one-meter perch may roost five adult birds. Perches are best made of bamboo or rounded sticks and not too big or too small. Treat perches with used engine oil or kerosene to keep away parasites. <br><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/4351.300x200.png" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></p> <table><tbody><tr><td>Chicken perches</td> </tr><tr><td> <p>(c) PSDA 2011</p> <p> </p> </td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p>However, if badly designed, these can result in pain and injury. Perches should be arranged so as to enable birds to easily move between them and other equipment, thus reducing the risk of collisions and subsequent bruising and/or other damage. Consideration should be given to minimizing bird stress and downgrading during catching at the end of the laying period. The ability to remove perches aids this process.<br><br><strong>Floors made of net are not acceptable for chicken</strong>, and they are harmful to the feed of the hens and chicken.

">predator</a>s and thieves. Laying nests ease egg collection and avoids eggs that are dirty and cracked. Eggs should be collected twice a daily at the same time each day (mid-morning and the evening). Removing eggs continuously is important to stop hens from going broody since broody hens stop laying.</p> <p><br><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/2947.300x200.jpg" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></p> <table align="left"><tbody><tr><td>Brooding hen</td> </tr><tr><td>(c) A. Wachira, KARI, Kenya</td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p> </p> <p>To reduce the impact of excessive aggression within a flock, and to avoid floor laying and wastage, it is important that sufficient nest boxes are available. The provision of perches and of ground-level nest boxes will also encourage the use of nest boxes amongst a greater proportion of hens. It is important that nest boxes are sufficiently accessible so that they can be easily cleaned between batches.</p> <div style="clear: both;"> </div> <table align="left" style="width: 40%; line-height: normal;"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="" src="../res/res/files/4352.300x200.png" style="border: 0px white; border-image: none;"></td> </tr><tr><td>Chicken nest box</td> </tr><tr><td>(c) Marete</td> </tr></tbody></table><p>Nests should be placed inside the chicken house and preferably above the ground. Provide one laying nest for every 5 hens. Brooding nests are individual nests and should be placed in quiet and dark places where eggs are easily removed. Once the hen is broody it may be necessary to remove her to an isolated place to avoid other hens disturbing her or going broody as well.</p> <p><br>Simple nests can be made out of clay, calabashes or baskets made of local fibres, cardboard or wooden boxes. Nests should have the correct measurement for the hen to feel comfortable. An individual nest box measures 30 x 30 x 30 cm. A calabash/nest basket or nests made out of clay measure 40 x 20 x 25 cm (upper <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Thickness or width. ">diameter</a> x height x lower <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Thickness or width.

Ensure that the nest is 1/3 full with litter material to make the hen feel secure. When necessary place &#39;dummy eggs&#39; (e.g. stone eggs) in the nests to train/attract the hens into using the nests. </p> <div>Mix ashes, tobacco leaves or other anti-parasitic substances with the nesting material. This will keep out most external parasites. External parasites reduce hatchability, since brooding hens spend too much time and energy leaving the nest, cleaning and scratching her body hence leaving the eggs cold.</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p><strong>Shelters for mother hen and chicks</strong> </p> <div>Upon hatching, it is important to keep the hen and chicks close together in a shelter. Shelter should protect chicks from adult poultry; feed competition with other poultry and protect against <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s. Shelters should provide a stable environment for the chicks and shelter from bad weather.</div> <div> </div> <div>Place the shelter on a mat to protect against the cold. A shelter of basketwork with a top hole (<a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Thickness or width. ">diameter</a> 20 cm) is useful, as feed and water may be changed without disturbing the chicks. It also gives the necessary ventilation. A woven mat on the floor may provide additional protection during cold weather. The mat should be cleaned daily to remove droppings and spilled/contaminated feed. Droppings may be recycled as farm manure.</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <p><strong>Litter management</strong> <br>Litter management is a vital component of managing the welfare of birds as ammonia release from poor litter can lead to conditions such as breast blister, hock burn, pododermatitis and respiratory disease. Management of litter in free range systems presents problems, particularly in winter when the weather is cold and litter is likely to become wet. <br><br>Three factors have particularly important effects on litter condition:<br><br>- litter moisture,<br>- greasy capped litter (resulting from too much fat in the feed or feed of poor quality); and<br>- Nitrogen in the litter.<br><br> </p> <p><strong>Chicken runs</strong><br>Chicken runs are a fenced open air space of 25 m2 or more where poultry are kept and protected against <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Animal that attacks and feeds on other animals, such as an insect (e.g. ladybird beetle), bird or spider feeding on pest insects. ">predator</a>s and thieves. Runs are also used for feeding, watering, for daily flock observation and collection of eggs. The walls are 2 meters high and can be made of clay or woven mat or chicken wire. A chicken run is relatively costly but provides security to the poultry.

Therefore, it is important to try to prevent pesticide resistance. ">resistance</a> to diseases and parasites, and subsequently increase flock mortality. It is important to note that even small flocks of indigenous chicken will starve during certain periods of the year (e.g drought, planting season when birds are confined, floods etc) when left to scavenge without supplementary feeding. </div> <p> </p><div>Egg production and growth are limited by access to feed and genetic potential. Local birds are the best converters of feed to eggs under fluctuating environmental conditions, although their production potential is much lower than genetically improved breeds.You may easily increase egg production and growth of local birds by giving supplementary feeds. Improved breeds also perform well under village conditions when given a steady supply of feeds.

Poultry need feed containing energy and protein, as well as vitamins, minerals and water. The need for feed will change, depending on the age and status (chicken, grower, egg layer, broody hen) of the bird. The cheapest - and also often the best - way to supplement the diet of your poultry, is to <strong>use local resources</strong>. However, many vitamins and nutrients are destroyed if the feed is stored too long or under sub-optimal conditions, e.g. high humidity and heat. Knowledge of feed quality and sources of different feed types is important for feed safety.</div> <div> </div> <div>If you have free range chicken, temporarily confined during planting season and during night, you can supply grains, by-products of grains or tubers besides the green forage and seeds they collect during scavenging. With a variety of feeds (plants and insects) also requirements for minerals, trace-elements and vitamins are likely to be met. Water should be available at all times. Young chicken should be fed easy to digest feeds that are energy and protein rich.</div> <p> </p> <h3> </h3> <h3><strong>Scavenging </strong></h3> <div>In a free-range or semi-intensive poultry rearing system, adult hens and cocks ought to be given enough time and space for scavenging in the surroundings daily. The best time for scavenging is early morning and late afternoon when there are plenty of insects and less heat. Chicks below six weeks of age should be confined. Supplementary feeds should be offered in the morning and evening when the birds come back for the night. Ad libitum clean water should be provided in shady areas during the day to avoid heat stress.</div> <div> </div> <div>If your production is based on improved breeds or hybrids for egg production, different types of <strong>commercial diets</strong> may be offered.

If the product price is lower than the price of feed consumed by the birds to produce it, it is not economical to offer commercial feeds. Indigenous chicks may be offered commercial diets profitably from day old to six weeks of age. </div> <h3> </h3> <h3 style="clear: both;"><strong>Types of feeds </strong></h3> <p><strong>Energy feeds</strong> </p><div>As a rule 75% of a quality poultry diet is made up of energy feeds. Energy feeds are the most important feeds for maintenance requirements (e.g. body temperature, vital functions, exercise). Cereal grains, roots and tubers are the most important energy feeds. Examples of energy feeds are cereals like maize and its by-products (bran), sorghum, wheat and its by-products (bran), rice and its byproducts (bran, polishing), cassava root meal, yams and sweet potatoes. </div> <div> </div> <div>Roots and tubers should be soaked in water for 60 minutes or cooked before drying to remove harmful substances and the proportion in the diet in general kept below 10%. Fat is also a good source of energy in particular in hot climates, as the heat produced during metabolism is less than from traditional energy feeds, e.g. cereals. Sources of fat are e.g.: tallow, lard, oil cake meals, hotel used oils and fat. Such oils and fats should only be given in small amounts, i.e. less than 10% of the total diet.</div> <div> </div> <p><br><strong>Protein</strong> </p><div>Protein is needed for growth and optimal health status. Normally no more than 20% of a poultry diet is made up of protein-rich feeds mainly due to high cost. Protein sources may originate from animals or plants. Examples of protein-rich local feeds are: Maggots, termite eggs, insects, worms, peas, beans, and oil cakes from e.g. ground nuts, cotton seeds, palm kernels, and coconuts. <strong>Animal byproducts such as meat meal or bone meal from chicken are not allowed</strong>, also fish meal is not allowed in organic farming. <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Manufactured by chemical and industrial processes. May include products not found in nature, or simulation of products from natural sources (but not extracted from natural raw materials). ">Synthetic</a> amino acids are not permitted. Some harmful substances (anti-nutrients) are present in some protein-rich plants e.g. beans. As such their proportion in the diet should be low based on type and processing prior to feeding. Note that feeds processed with chemicals are not allowed in organic.</div> <div> </div> <p><br><strong>Minerals</strong> </p><div>Minerals are important for bone formation, eggshell formation and for optimal health status. The most important minerals are calcium and phosphorous. To produce strong egg shells, laying hens need free access to calcium (limestone or crushed shells). Mature birds are usually able to balance their mineral intake according to their requirements. When phosphorous rich feeds are added to the diet, they should be balanced with calcium rich feeds, since high levels of one mineral will cause deficiency of the other. Examples of sources for minerals are: bone meal, limestone and burned eggshells. The use of bone meal or eggshells is a good way of balancing calcium and phosphorus levels in the diet. Eggshells should always be scorched or cooked before re-use in diets to remove contaminants.</div> <div> </div> <p><br><strong>Vitamins</strong> </p><div>Scavenging birds get vitamins from eating green grass, vegetables, fresh cow dung and through sunlight. Vitamins A, B2, and D3 are important because many problems arise when birds are deficient. Sunlight and green grass or green fodder normally provide Vitamin A and D, whereas Vitamin B may come from fresh cow dung. Vitamin B may also be added by giving multivitamins. Additional vitamins are given in very small quantities and purchased from agrovet stores or feed stockists. Supplementary vitamins are usually not required when birds are left to scavenge. Confined or intensively management birds always need additional vitamins added into their feeds.</div> <div> </div> <p><br><strong>Simple feed mixing</strong> </p><div>It is advisable to make a semi-balanced diet for the small chicks from 0-6 weeks of age. Locally available <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="is a substance, including a food additive, used in the manufacture or preparation of a food or present in the final although possibly in a modified form.">ingredient</a>s should be dried in the shade (the sun may destroy important vitamins) and grounded in a mortar before mixing. Locally available containers such as plastic tins or matchboxes may be used for easy quantification of the different <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="is a substance, including a food additive, used in the manufacture or preparation of a food or present in the final although possibly in a modified form.">ingredient</a>s. Grams or percentages should be transferred into local quantities for field practice. Large ready-mixed quantities should only be stored, if adequate storage capacities are assured (see under &quot;Twelve simple rules&quot;). In general mixed feeds should not be stored for more than a few weeks to avoid <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Pollution of organic product or land; or contact with any material that would render the product unsuitable for organic certification. ">contamination</a> from mould, bacteria or rodents and to avoid losing vitamins. Above 8 weeks of age, poultry may be fed in a cafeteria system saving time and energy on mixing feeds. The cafeteria system is described below.</div> <div> </div> <p><strong>Table of Simple ration for supplementing local chicks from day-old to 8 weeks (total 930 g)</strong> </p> <table border="1" style="width: 90%;"><tbody><tr><td><strong><a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="is a substance, including a food additive, used in the manufacture or preparation of a food or present in the final although possibly in a modified form.">Ingredient</a></strong></td> <td><strong>Quantity</strong></td> </tr><tr><td>1) Crushed maize/sorghum or millet</td> <td>1 kg tin </td> </tr><tr><td>2) Wheat/sorghum or millet bran</td> <td>1 kg tin</td> </tr><tr><td>3) Sunflower/sesame/groundnut cake</td> <td>2 match boxes</td> </tr><tr><td>4) Fishmeal/salt mix</td> <td>1 match boxes</td> </tr><tr></tr><tr><td>5) Sesbania/leucaena leaves </td> <td>2 match boxes</td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p>Termites or maggots may also be added during the first 8 weeks. Depending on the types of crops grown in the locality cereals, oil cakes etc maybe substituted. Alternatively a commercial chick starter ration can be used from day old to 8 weeks of age. In this way you will ensure that the chicks have the daily requirements during the most vulnerable weeks.</p> <p><br><strong>Simple techniques for growing maggots and termites</strong><br>Maggots and termites are a cheap source of protein in semi-intensive poultry production systems. However, they are a supplement to other feeds. Maggots or termites should be offered to young chicks since they require quality protein sources for optimal growth</p> <p>Maggots may be grown by a simple technique. Blood, offal and cow dung are mixed in a large open pot. The pot is filled with 1/3 water. Flies will lay their eggs in the mixture and maggots hatch and feed on the mixture. Leave the pot open during daytime and closed during the night. After 5 - 10 days (depending on temperature) the maggots will be ready to pupate. Collect the maggots by gently pouring water into the pot. The maggots will float and you can then wash them and feed them directly to the birds. Remember to place the pot away from public places, as the smell at times may be offensive.</p> <p><br><strong>Growing termites</strong><br>Take a pot with a short neck and a capacity of at least 10 litres. Fill it up with cow dung and straw and sprinkle a little water on content. Set the pot upside down with the opening on sandy soil. After one day and one night, the pot will be full of termites and you may empty the living contents in front of the hen house in the morning.</p> <p><br><strong>Other feedstuffs</strong> <br>Algae and water plants material have been considered appropriate for feeding poultry since they provide carotenoids and other fat-soluble vitamins. The carotenoids improve the colour of the egg yolks and together with vitamin E enhance the egg quality and the viability of the hatchlings. The deeper the egg yolk colour and pigmentation, the greater is the supply with vitamin A to the consumer. <br>Where available, the mixing of dried molasses with protein feeds have been shown to improve nutritional status of chicken.</p> <p><br>Dung heaps from the waste of cattle, goats and sheep are excellent sources of insect protein but also may act s sources of parasites (e.g. coccidia) and other diseases.<br><br>A Link to: <a href="../Publications/Keeping-village-poultry-technical-manual-small-scale-poultry-production.html">Keeping Village Poultry.

This so-called scavenging feed resource base (SFRB) will change over the seasons based on climate, geography and production system in the area on which the poultry scavenge for feeds. Depending on the season, the chicken may find nearly all they need in the surroundings (e.g. during harvest) or nothing (during lean season).</div> <p> </p> <p><strong>Table: Amount of feed at different ages of local poultry </strong></p> <table border="1" style="width: 40%;"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Age (wks)</strong></td> <td><strong>Intake/bird/day (g dry weight)</strong></td> </tr><tr><td>1 week</td> <td>12 - 15</td> </tr><tr><td>2 weeks </td> <td>15 - 21</td> </tr><tr><td>3 weeks </td> <td>21 - 35</td> </tr><tr><td>4 - 6 weeks </td> <td>35 - 50</td> </tr><tr><td>7 - 8 weeks </td> <td>55 - 60</td> </tr><tr><td>16 - 27 weeks </td> <td>68 - 80</td> </tr><tr><td>28 weeks </td> <td>100</td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p>Limit the quantity of feed offered to the birds daily to at least 30% - 50% of their full daily intake. Allow a maximum of 30 - 40 g/bird/day from week 4 - 6 and gradually reducing the supplementary feeding. At day old to 4 weeks young chicks will receive feed according to their needs. As the birds grow, they will gradually get a smaller portion of what they need, until they only get between 1/3 and half of their needs as adults. Economic benefits are calculating the break-even point from the sale of eggs and live birds relative to the cost of disease control, housing, labour and feeds.</p> <div>To ensure sustained egg production, offer feeds when the chicken need it rather than less quantities during the harvest season and more during the lean season. Reduce the flock size through selling some chicken when feed costs are high rather than reducing the amount of feed given to each bird. </div> <p> <strong> </strong><br></p><div style="clear: both;"> </div> <div style="clear: both;"><strong>How to feed?</strong></div> <div>It is important to use simple local measures to administer feeds. By using a table, you can calculate how much feed to use. Fig. shows calculated daily feed requirements based on a flock of 1 cock, 4 hens and 15 three week old chicks. </div> <p><br><strong>Table: Simple calculation for daily feed requirements</strong></p> <table border="1" style="width: 40%;"><tbody><tr><td>1 cock: </td> <td>35 g. = 35</td> </tr><tr><td>4 hens: </td> <td>4 x 35 g. = 140</td> </tr><tr><td>15 chicks: </td> <td>15 x 25 g. = 375 </td> </tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td> <td><strong>= at least 550 g per day</strong></td> </tr></tbody></table><p> </p> <p>When using 1 kg containers (or a cup) measure the amount of feed the container holds, and then calculate the number of containers of feed needed daily. If the container holds 750 g of feed you will need to fill the container 3/4 full. To keep the birds hungry for scavenging, offer half the feed in the morning, which will be equal to a half full container. To avoid competition, feed the young chicks a little more than half in a separate shelter. Feed the hens next and finally before the feeder is empty feed the cock. When cocks are offered feed before the other birds, they over eat and leave less feed for the rest of the flock. Cocks are better at scavenging within the surrounding than the rest of the birds. Young chicks will need relatively more protein in their diet than adult birds hence the need to mix two different rations for young and adult birds, respectively. If you do not want to mix two different rations, you can alternatively give a little extra supplement of a good protein source to the young chickens, e.g. maggots and termites. <br> </p> <p><strong>Cafeteria system</strong> </p> <div>Adult birds are able to mix their own feed according to their needs. The best way to feed semi-intensively managed birds above 8 weeks of age is a cafeteria system, whereby various types of feeds are offered separately. An important condition is that feeds are palatable to the same extent. If not they will be refused even when they are needed in the ration</div> <p> </p><div>Feeders are divided into three compartments, enabling the poultry to choose the feed <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="is a substance, including a food additive, used in the manufacture or preparation of a food or present in the final although possibly in a modified form.">ingredient</a> according to their needs.</div> <p> In the cafeteria system, there should be at least one feeding compartment for:<br>A. Energy rich feeds, e.g. maize, millet, sorghum.<br>B. Protein rich feeds, e.g. beans, peas, oil cakes, maggots, termites.<br>C. Mineral rich feeds, e.g. burned eggshells.<br> </p><div>An additional compartment for oil rich feeds may be added, e.g. tallow, oil cake meals, fish oil. By giving adult birds feeds in compartments, observe their feeding behaviour and avoid feeding unnecessary amounts and types of feed. For example, during harvest seasons you may find that they birds feed less on energy feeds in the evenings because there is plenty of cereal in the environment. You may also try out alternative feeds that the birds do not find tasteful. The cafeteria system is a good way of learning about your birds&#39; behaviour and taste.</div> <div> </div> <p><br><strong>Feeding Hybrid layers</strong> <br>Hybrid layers have quite easy feeding regimes, as the feed they need is manufactured and can be ready bought. However if you want to have nice yellow eggs also green vegetables wastes and forage such as grass, lucerne or kales needs to be provided. Preferably the greens should be hung up in a string so the birds have to jump a bit to reach them. This gives both good exercise and avoids too much mess to clean up later. Yolk colour maybe influenced by the genotype and the rate of egg production but feed composition is the major influencing factor. Both natural and <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Manufactured by chemical and industrial processes. May include products not found in nature, or simulation of products from natural sources (but not extracted from natural raw materials). ">synthetic</a> sources of pigmenting egg yolks are in use commercially. Feeds stabilized with antioxidants such as vitamin E and A improve yolk colour pigmentation.

One metre trough or a 35 cm (<a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Thickness or width. ">diameter</a>) tube feeder is big enough for 20 adult birds to eat and for 40 to drink. Feeders and drinkers may easily be produced out of local materials. An empty tin placed upside down on a plate forms a drinker. By keeping the tin upside down the water is not contaminated with dirt. Make two small holes near the rim diagonal to each other. Pour clean water in the can. Put a flat plate with a small rim on top and turn the can and plate upside down, while pressing them against each other.</div> <p>Gently place the drinker on the ground. The rim of the plate should be low enough for young chicks to drink, but also high enough for adult birds to dip their wattles to keep them cool during the hot weather. Usually several waterers in different sizes should be used. Ensure that feeders minimize feed wastage. Feed wastage can be minimized when feeders are not filled to the top.

It is caused by sub-species <em>S. pullorum</em> and it is severe by chicks. It is transmitted from hen to chicks during egg formation, <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Pollution of organic product or land; or contact with any material that would render the product unsuitable for organic certification. ">contamination</a> of eggs during laying or the chicksget infected form faeces. <br>Symptoms: dead embryo in eggs that do not hatch; chicks develop wet tails within the first week; whitish diarrhoea, chicks walk with difficulty, show big bellies and drag their wings, huddling anddifficulty in breathing. Mortality can reach 100% in the first two weeks. </li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Fowl typhoid</strong>. It is caused by the species <em>S. gallinarum</em> and it affects growers and adult chickens.

">acute</a> in chicks and chronic in adult chicken. Common in newly hatched chicks. Chicks get contaminated through eggs and contaminated faeces, while feed and water transmit the disease to both chicks and adults. It can be prevented by keeping good egg and nest sanitation. <br>Symptoms: Respiratory distress, diarrhoea, high mortality of chicks and dead embryos in spoiled eggs. </li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Infectious Coryza.</strong> This disease can be <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="means beginning abruptly with marked intensity or sharpness, then subsiding after a relatively short period. ">acute</a>, mild or chronic. <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="Pollution of organic product or land; or contact with any material that would render the product unsuitable for organic certification. ">Contamination</a> occurs by faecal matter, aerosols or through feed and water. It can be prevented by vaccination with bacterin in water at 10 to 12 weeks and 16 to 18 weeks.<br>Symptoms: Swollen watery eyes, closed eyes, nasal discharge (runny nose), laboured breathing and decrease in egg production. All clinically ill chicken should be destroyed.</li> </ul><ul><li><strong>Fowl Cholera (Pasteurellosis).</strong> This may occur at all ages of chicken, causing infection of the stomach region. <br>Symptoms: severe diarrhea, breathing problems, loss of appetite, blue combs and wattles. May occur as a cronic disease or as sudden death. Infection is mainly through contaminated feed and drinking water. There is no treatment. Best prevention is strict hygiene and vaccination. Destroy through killing and burn affected birds. </li> </ul><p><br><br><strong>Prevention and control </strong></p> <div>Salmonella and other <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="disease causing ">pathogenic</a> bacteria are present in the air and feaces of most animals, and can even be present in some of the food items bought in the shops. Bacterial diseases can be prevented through good hygiene and sanitation. Which means regular cleaning of chicken houses and runs, regular <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="To reduce, by physical or chemical means, the number of potentially harmful microorganisms in the environment, to a level that does not compromise food safety and suitability. ">disinfect</a>ions with lime, etc. Some diseases such as fowl typhoid can be prevented by vaccinating the birds. <br><br><strong>Note: Do not vaccinate sick birds.</strong></div> <h3> </h3> <h3><strong>4) Parasitic diseases</strong></h3> <div>Parasites are organisms that live in or on a host (animal or plant); the parasite obtains nourishment from the host without benefiting or killing the host. Chicken parasites include lice and fleas, and worms living in the opening of organs. They may cause diseases and weaken the immune-system, making the chicken susceptible to other diseases.</div> <div style="clear: both;">Worms</div> <p>Worms inhabit the alimentary canal and other internal organs such as lungs, trachea, etc. There are two groups of worms: round worms and flat worms.<br><br><strong>a) Round worms </strong></p> <ul><li><em>Ascridia galli</em>. They infect both chicks and adult chicken. Infection occurs through eggs that are laid by female worms in birds&#39; entestines and are passed out in droppings. They mature in one week or longer, and are swallowed up by chicken, hatch and cause new infection. Prevention is difficult due to feeding habits, especially by scavenging chicken.<br>Symptoms: Slow growth and stunted, culled feathers and drooping head, thirst, low egg production and death due to intestinal obstruction in young birds.</li> <li>Gape worms (<em>Syngamus treachea</em>). They infect the trachea (windpipe) of chicken. Adult worms live and lay eggs in the birds trachea; the eggs get coughed out or get swallowed into the oesophagus and discarded via faeces. The eggs hatch to larvae which infect chicken or enter intermediate hosts such as beetles and earthworms. <br>Symptoms: Difficulty in breathing and gasping for air (thus the term gapeworm), huddling, and death fue to suffocation.</li> </ul><p><br><strong>b) Flat worms</strong> </p> <ul><li>Tape worm (<em>Raillietina tetragona</em>) infests scavenging chicken. The worms release the eggs free or retained in a segment. Beetles and snails ingest the eggs. The eggs develop in these intermediate hosts infecting chicken that feed on them. Prevention occurs by using clean containers.<br>Symptoms: Stunting, Thirst, poor health, low egg production and death of young birds on poor diets.</li> </ul><p><br><strong>Prevention and cure: </strong>Intestinal worms in chicken are controlled by regular deworming with recommended deworming medicine usually mixed with drinking water.<br> </p> <div style="clear: both;"><strong>c) External parasites</strong></div> <ul><li>The most common external parasites include lice, mites, fleas and ticks. They infest poultry houses and breed in cracks of the buildings. Infestation occurs through infected birds and pets, and affect all ages of birds but are severe in chicks.</li> <li>Prevention can be done by maintaining cleaniliness of the poultry nests and houses and sealing cracks in the walls and on the floors.</li> <li>Lice can be seen around eyes and nose. They lay eggs on the feathers and suck blood from chicken, causing discomfort.</li> </ul><div> </div> <div>Mites live in cracks in the poultry houses, not on the host. They suck blood from the birds at night and remain in the cracks during the day. In severe infections, birds become anaemic. Fleas can be seen on the belly. They suck blood from birds after which they drop and lay eggs in the litter. The eggs mature to adult fleas, which can survive for up to a month without feeding. Attacks all ages any time, but occurs more frequently in humid chicken houses with bad hygiene. Adult birds are clearly disturbed and spend a lot of time pecking and polishing feathers. Young chicks may die from anemia. If not treated, mites, lice, fleas, ticks will cause weight loss and possibly loss of feathers due to the parasites sucking blood and to skin irritation </div> <div> </div> <div><strong>Treatment:</strong> Spray or dust with pesticides, ashes, and oil. Ashes and sulphur powder may be used where the hens do dust bathing. Nests may be protected by putting a few tobacco leaves mixed with ashes in the nests.</div> <p><br><strong>External parasites (behaviour and parasites) Scaly legs </strong></p> <div>Scaly leg is caused by an external parasite irritating the skin on the birds&#39; legs.</div> <div><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Legs clearly have scales and wounds and may become crippled in their appearance.<br><strong>Treatment:</strong> Dip the legs daily in kerosene, oil or in an insecticide until the scales disappear.</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <h3><strong>5) Viral diseases</strong></h3> <p>Viruses can be prevented by vaccination. They are the smallest germs and can cause incurable diseases. There is no treatment for virus diseases.</p> <p><strong>a) Newcastle disease</strong></p> <div>Newcaste is the most economically important and the only notifiable disease in chicken. Often 30-80% of the flock dies. It is spread by dogs, birds, wild birds and man. There is no cure, affected chicken must be killed in a most humane way. Prevention occurs only by early vaccination. </div> <div><br><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Respiratory stress, lack of appetite, green diarrhoea, nervous symptoms and high mortality. Death can also be sudden without symptoms.

They perform an essential role in all ecosystems in decomposing organic matter and are indispensable in nutrient cycling and exchange. Some fungi become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or molds. [br][br] Fungi are responsible for a range of serious plant diseases such as blight, grey mould, bunts, powdery mildew, and downy mildew. Crops of all kinds often suffer heavy losses. [br][br] Fungal plant diseases are usually managed with applications of chemical fungicides or heavy metals. In some cases, conventional breeding has provided fungus resistantcultivars. [br][br] Besides combatting yield losses, preventing fungal infection keeps crops free of toxic compounds produced by some pathogenic fungi. These compounds, often referred to as mycotoxins, can affect affect the immune system and disrupt hormone balances. Some mycotoxins are carcinogenic.

Research has shown that protection against e.g. Newcastle disease is highly variable if vaccine is given through water or feed. Giving the right dose is essential for the vaccine to work properly. A too high dose of a live vaccine may kill a young chick, whereas a too low dose will not give adequate protection. Thus, it is important to consult a veterinarian or auxiliary veterinarians (barefoot vets, village vaccinators) for further advice before carrying out a vaccination.</li> <li>Tools for application normally include a clean apron (green or other dark colour if possible) vaccine vial (B) stored in a cool box (C), soap to clean hands (D), clean needles (E), clean syringe (G) and a clean box for needles and syringe (F). Needles and syringe should be boiled in water for 5 minutes and cooled before re-use</li> <li>It is important to treat the clean syringe and needle carefully. Do no touch the end of the needle after cleaning. Put the needle gently on the syringe holding the needle with the sharp end upwards . Put the vaccine vial upside-down and press the needle gently through the plastic seal of the vial cap. Pull the syringe handle gently down, while sucking the vaccine out of the vial until the syringe is full. Press the syringe handle back until you reach the right volume.</li> <li>Ensure that there are no air bubbles trapped in the syringe or the needle. Air bubbles will give the wrong dose to the chickens. Normally a full 1 ml syringe will match 10 doses, one for each of ten adult birds. This however depends on the weight of the bird and the type of vaccine, and the application method.</li> <li>The most common methods for vaccinating adult poultry are eye drops (A), injections in the breast or thigh muscles (B) or by piercing the skin of the wing (C). The most common methods for young chicks are eye drops and skin piercing. When the birds grow older, injections are given in the breast or thigh muscles. Depending on the vaccine type, eye drops may also be used for adult birds. Please consult the local veterinarian for clarification and technical information</li> <li>Vaccines should be given either early morning, before letting the birds out of the chicken house or when the local birds are easy to catch resting in the trees. When vaccinating adult poultry for the first time, you should preferably be two persons, one holding the bird, the other one vaccinating.</li> </ul><p><br> </p> <p><strong>General precautions for vaccination with live vaccines:</strong> <br> </p> <ul><li>All vaccines should be stored in a refrigerator before use.</li> </ul><ul><li>Some vaccines are heat stable, which means that the vaccine will tolerate high temperatures. However, heat stable vaccines should also be stored in a cold place to keep them viable. You should always keep vaccines out of direct sunlight.</li> </ul><ul><li>When using vaccines in the field, you should as far as possible transport them in a cool box with ice.</li> </ul><ul><li>The syringe, needle and other equipment to be used for vaccination should not be cleaned by any chemical <a class="lexicon-term" href="javascript:;" title="To reduce, by physical or chemical means, the number of potentially harmful microorganisms in the environment, to a level that does not compromise food safety and suitability.
